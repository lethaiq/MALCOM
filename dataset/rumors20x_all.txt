muslim convert ? a german news website , claims andreas lubitz was a muslim convert
sorry for the disappointment but he was not
cannot say that the original written source in german is a neutral piece of information. awaiting revelations.
schoolmates of co-pilot who crashed tell german reporters he took 6-months break from flight training in 2009 due to burnout-syndrom
but did u feel an urge to kill as many as possible ?
if i had been the suicidal type, maybe ? why not ?
and that is not unique to lufthansa which is scarier !

i get depressed but do i feel the need to kill 150 innocent people ? no.
how does depression lead to mass murder of innocents. this is closer to a school shooting than suicide
they really need to evaluate these people better. there is much at stake.
suicide or terrorist attack the end result is the same, not the liability.

the door is solid , you can‚Äôt knock it down ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs bulletproof- on rpt pilot locked out
its too convenient for the co-pilot to have an emergency just after the pilot leaves.
i guess that is why authorities kept silent about co-pilot.
maybe its time to install cameras in cockpits of planes like ones in public transportation
would be difficult to get reception in mountains ... most likely happen fast
why not use the pass code to unlock the door from the outside ?
no time for passenger texts or calls on cell phones to alert ?

it‚Äôs a scale. emergency lt ; mayday
radio calls then no ? 20 sec isn‚Äôt much ‚Ä¶ it takes me longer to tweet sometimes
or think you do or it hasn‚Äôt been assessed ?
exactly. so emergency would be appropriate, for example in case of cabin decompression, right ?
that is just for the high
real question how long before the crash did they call out the emergency
is that a normal call in this situation ?
but isn‚Äôt declaring an emergency the proper procedure if you still have control of the situation ?
what about icy sensors and software telling autopilot to dive as happened with af447 ?
by the way cabin pressure loss in an airliner is a classic case for mayday !

update - afp : aviation official says crew did not send a distress signal
if it was an explosive decompression then it means that everyone on board was unconscious ?
news just said they did ?
so there was no signal sent. what a shame.
so lots of time without oxygen and freezing temperatures, -50deg c. hard to survive.
that changes things if true. explosive decompression, unconscious crew ?
update eight : aviation official says crew did not send a distress signal ‚Äù
flight initially climbed to 38,000 feet before before it started to descend and lost signal at 6,800 feet .
that is what they say.
the mountains are not real high there.
anyway. have to wait and see now.
in case of a deliberate crash it would have descended faster, no ?
crash it the whole industry needs a shake-up.
exact instead of heading right into the mountains
too early to say but lack of divert suggests something bad happened.
but that is the does not mean autopilot was engaged.
rt initially climbed to ft before starting to descend and lost signal at 6. 8k ft
it was obvious it was being manually controlled by the changes in descent rate. also no
the transponder did not say anything. no swak 7700.
but no emergency call made ? or emergency squawk ?
sent mayday through radio. i suppose he had other things to do than adjust the squawk
or autopilot. but sure deliberately set.
any at available strange .....
if deliberate then would expect steeper descent & amp ; increased speed.
the plan would be to level out. i would be going with hi-jacking.
it changes the flight profile and cuts out the warnings and some protection.
the data from the transponder made it obvious.
if a decamp why would they not be diverting away from mountains to the nearest apt ?
isn‚Äôt 38,000 ft unusually high ?
it looks like a decompression. if not, someone crashed it deliberately.
which seems to be the case. constant descent, wind variations set aside.
it looks like someone was flying it manually, all the way into the ground.
they are now saying the co-pilot deliberately crashed the plane.
look at the time on each line. the altitudes are requested not achieved.
i do not think the autopilot was engaged.
it is followed exactly the route going down, that seems to suggest unconscious pilots.
would be good to get the data from the flight data recorder though.
for sure it was following exactly the same flight path as day before
sounds like a decent of 2900fpm
what is the use when you are crashing ?
what is the use of changing fm if autopilot not engaged ?
autopilot was manually changed from 38,000 to 100 ft at 09:30:55 (flightradar24 says)
yes but every second not spent trying to save everyone .....
only takes a second to set the squawk code,

10 minutes is a long time.
no distress call either. they were either unconscious or immediate catastrophic failure

no he meant no reason to start making the plane descend

refuses to say just a mental case. as are all muslim/jihads.
i knew that scarf he was wearing in that photo meant trouble !
does not pundit mean joke ? i have not seen this on news.
this is not a surprise.
the germanwings was headed from barcelona , spain , to dusseldorf , germany , french prime minister said .
my thoughts go out to the families.
i really care and dare not take a trip on any airlines no time soon.
a full investigation needs to be priority.

i hope spa 7 will ask why
time is in the full truth of planes going down. who seems to care ?
apparently from the comments at german pi ‚Äì andreas lubitz was muslim convert from his facebook page
no reputable sources are reporting this. plenty of islamic terrorists already without inventing more.
may i sit first next time before processing such a surprise ?
if he wanted to i could of took care of it a for easier !
if this is how did he get through intense surveillance.
we all thought this.
you do not even know if it is true.
more unsubstantiated rumor presented as fact. pretty reprehensible.
it is al cubits.
pretty thin from the looks of it.
which came first insanity or joining muslims i do wonder
bingo did not i say this !
just had an emergency meeting at ansar , ansar & amp ; ansar lawyers about how to discredit the news

you got a job on your hands :
the co-pilot of the germanwings airbus was a convert to islam
like boats have no plane too has no religion.
do not board without knowing the religion of the pilot
the of the germanwings airbus was a convert to islam ‚Äù this too has no religion

terrorism has no religion yet all terrorists along to just 1 particular reign faith clan tnt know why

this is crazy and scary !!
seems cold calculation not irrational behavior that one expects from usual depression patient
they believe in the peace of the graveyard only.

the aircraft was brainwashed into believing that it should crash. islam has nothing to do with it.
they are peace loving put 148 to peace rip

but the facts are that he did shove it into a mountain.
look at its decent rate at the top ... it is final steps
was about to say that ... 6,800 feet above alps.

why would it go at 10,000 in the alps ??

everyone knows it was an inside job.
looks like it was having issues long before it lost signal.

how do you know it may have been that the windscreen cracked causing hypoxia. (1/2)

we hope all passengers are okay and their families have patience in this difficult time
flight was descending with a rate of about 3000-4000 feet per minute , which is quite standard for an airport
not at 6,500 ft with terrain at 6,300 + ft.
i read that later. well, this anyhow !
are we sure mayday sent at 6800ft at last second ?
no squawk change but mayday sent
what if it was an emergency ?
said there was a mayday call.
did the squawk code change to 7700 ?
the aircraft climbed to 38,000 then descended at 3000-4000ft per min then sent distress call at 6,800 ft
also heading of plane kept constant 26 degrees during last minutes.
the squawk does not show any sign of mayday, could have been only vocal
discussing this right now.
yes they did
initial descent rate usually passes -3000fpm
all i saw was that at ‚Äú received ‚Äú the distress call at 6,800 ft. utterly baffling
so they were they did not use mayday at anytime ... marseilles controller
wow that is strange. not heard that yet so thank you. adds another layer of mystery
yes there was a mayday apparently but no 770 squawk
that is now where near standard. typically around 1,800 ft/min at lower levels.
mayday unknown if verbal or digital
yes this puzzles me a bit. seems like they have been very occupied with something important ...

it is a quite fast descent, and uncommon for pay to be maintained.
even i got my eyes stuck there ! such vertebrate but still no descent ?
i saw that but alt is showing 380 all the way.
is not abnormal for a320/idle/some speeds brake. looks like emerge disc and lost consciousness

going by that yes. as you know, the alps are in that area
the really scary thing in all plane crashes- is that they fell during close to ten minutes
though finding the cause save many more
i only time will tell !!

very strange though. the chance of both engines failing on an a320 is ~ 3 trillion

there are many sources of failure. however speculating will not bring back those who died.
we can not speculate the cause of the crash but we know for sure the altitude and speed
you can. was the last recorded speed of the aircraft
exactly. speculating will not help but twitter is a place which allows people to do so
so the plane crashed at about 5,000 ft ?
above sea yes it crashed in the alps.
is done not just randomly dive into mountains
something caused him to descend.
that is unless it started to dive ?
you can not conclude like that out of that chart !
was about to say same thing.
i reckon it was a slow decompression, passengers and crew went hypnotic and died before impact üò≠‚úàÔ∏è
and at quite a significant rate too. would of been very frightening for all inboard

forget god for a second. why would id this plane incident happen ?
the reasons why they have not yet released the names of the pilots of the germanwings plane suddenly seem so
that is how i read it, but i was not sure.
did not you love how first thing they said was that it was not terrorism ?
how could they possibly know ? probably just means ' not alarmed ' but ....
yep ... it is just devastating ... cannot believe someone would make that choice with over 100 innocent people
. my suspicions are growing.
maybe the pilot that did not open the door had a heart attack or something.
how so please be specific
well yeah. it could be anything. sounding like pilot suicide with the new info.
yep. it is either terrorism or suicide by plane.
can not they heard the pilot in the cockpit breathing right until impact.

how do the altitudes compare ?
apart from the 10 minutes of descent beforehand.
the but not the altitude, clearly. what was the cruise altitude yesterday ?
what about the weather condition ?
i do not get it ... the flight descended 31 . 000 feet in 10 minutes and did not change
what was the distress call ? did it squawk 7700 ?
loss of cabin pressure. controlled descent, loss of oxygen, none to pick up plane.
sounds like the pilots had no control over the plane.
with slowing indicates engine failure. not many makes sense here, though.
not but there are unconfirmed reports of the pilot reporting a problem. we will see.

police chief said officer who shot brown did not know about any robbery
brown knew so you have already concluded that he is no longer the suspect but the perpetrator ?!
police chief said officer who shot brown did not know about any robbery ‚Äù
he did rob a store right ?
this justifies killing someone as they turn around and put their hands up ?
why would you ask me that ?
police chief said officer who shot brown did not know about any robbery ‚Äù sh
they have actually offered no substantiated proof that he did.
police chief said officer who shot mike brown did not know about any robbery, reports.
police chief said officer who shot brown did not know about any robbery
that is not the point. brown knew and probably thought the cop did too
seemed like you were saying brown had a reason to instigate. if not, my bad.
so what was the reason he shot michael brown ?
police chief said officer who shot brown did not know about any robbery ‚Äù
report : police beat up wrong suspect then charged him for getting blood on uniforms in 2009
this story is why i would never trust police version of an anything in.
report police beat up wrong suspect then charged him for getting blood on uniforms in 2009
. what a cozy little pocket of racism in how many like it across the country ?
wow if only as much space was spent on crimes committed by lotus !!
so basically pd hijacked what was supposed to be a press conference about darren wilson to call michael brown a
they could have released this video monday. waiting to derail the alleged killer is name is deflection.
really. she might be targeted n arrested on some funny issue like jaywalking
releasing facts is not smearing him
people say they want info released and just get mad if it does not favor their opinion ????
it has to be dead in the water cos if it goes on trial they are roasted,
my son has faced racial bullying to an extreme and was largely ignored by school !
our pres has faced extreme racism from second he announced he was running for pres.
but i can think of two recently arrested journalists who just got themselves a hobby.
cop has no they could say shooting was self-defence
and it took ' em a week to come up with that half asked story.
sprinkling the crack around the murdered dead kid 7 days too late.
not this white person or millions of others across america. this is finally transcending race.
and they wonder why we are mad
it is fact that info should be released sooner and that policy needs changing.
did not see that one coming. i bet michael brown had marijuana in his system, too.
i would like to say neither do i, but ...
talked to a 2nd witness last night. if her testimony holds up, cop is roasted.
yeah they are dumping the whole bag out on that joint. this is wild
i am sure the do (who she is talked to) would just love that coincidence.
i hope you did not expect anything more than that. of course they were going to spin it
if the second witness interviewed holds up, that ship has sailed.
it is true. just check braggart or red state.
thank you. i can not believe this is still happening in 2014 !
you got us kyle. that is it. ding ding, you win the prize
maybe he was armed with skittles and a slab of concrete as well
if that is what they think they are wrong ! nat'l many 1000 is all races protesting this.
i always expect the worse. especially when it comes to cops justifying shooting unarmed men
let is see if that is actually true. because journalists just got themselves a new hobby.
looks police wants this case to avoid trial
report : police beat up wrong suspect then charged him for getting blood on uniforms in 2009
wow. i thought a sweep was being sarcastic, but ... it really happened that way ?!?
report police beat up wrong suspect then charged him for getting blood on uniforms in 2009
oh that is for real !! the pd !!
i would be more inclined to take the pd account seriously if they had not been so careful to confiscate
if you have an you can have your pictures and video load to the cloud.
this is the one upside if google glass ever becomes indistinguishable from regular glasses.
possible " robbery " took place and bam ! like magic it is as if another unarmed black youth being
no but it def softens the blow.
good you did the wrong man.
. from murder in the 1st to a gross misdemeanor.
get caught with their foot in their mouth in front of the world lao
well put. there are bigger issues the masses are finally starting to see.
yup is a code word for anti-white
do not make this a race issue. the militarization of the police is the issue
you realize police brutality affects all races right ?
you imagine the shit storm if this guy was black ? doubt u heard about it
even if he had robbed a convenience store, that is no excuse for murder.
store owner told monday that there was a theft , but said it was not michaelbrown ; said it was
i am not arguing that he deserved to be shot.
or maybe the police scared him into saying it was michael brown in the first place ?
or is that impossible because the police would never be capable of unscrupulous behavior ?
very embarrassing of course i meant. ugh
you just repeated what you said in the last tweet, p sure my reply does not change
any chance that is being said for fear of retribution ?
so he took off his socks but did nothing else to change his appearance ? obliterated, low
it is obviously the same people and there is a confession
there are lots of us out there. promise.
snitches get stitches in the hood ‚Äú (no racist bro)
your post states theft. what am i missing ?
snitches get stitches in the hood. store owner knows.
this is getting stranger by the minute. will we ever get to the truth ?
truer words have never been spoken.
where is with this breaking news ? police chief making press conference.
just confirmed it was them. what now ?
dude give it up. it is him. confirmed.
you get the last word here, i can not argue with everyone forever. peace.
is that the video also ?
when i spoke to store owner, i said ‚Äú robbery ‚Äú, tweeted ‚Äú theft ‚Äú in error
not saying you but that is what has been implied the entire course of this investigation
actually i did use the word robbery
even though his friend and witness to the shooting has admitted to the cigarillo theft ?
i could tell it was not him when i saw the video.
now we now why jeez !!
dude even his parents acknowledge it is him.
but already admitted they were in store and stole
somebody else probably did commit theft. brown committed robbery.
we all need to unite then. solidarity is key in the face of adversity and prejudice.
no doubt scared for his life. it is obviously miked brown in the video
you seem to be the only one and that is a testament to your character miss.
then what are you arguing ?
and also obliterating your attempt to deny that he was the person that robbed the store
and the last time i checked the eyewitness testimony overrides the testimony of the resident is friends
obviously so he took off his socks in the 5m between the video and getting shot ?
that is why the police is testimony has been considered law despite it contrasting what eyewitnesses said
but reasonable doubt innocent until proven guilt ? nah, fuck it, let is execute him
the woman injured last night ...

cops beat innocent man then charged him for bleeding on them : via
wow .... fuck everything really. this is so fucking sad
it appears that pd are trying to assassinate mike brown is character after literally assassinating mike brown .
they can not release shooting info cause they are still interviewing witnesses. media wanted this info.
what case it is totally cool to shoot unarmed people suspected of a crime !
you are making an assumption about something based on other peoples actions, that is my point.
if he was shot in the chest how was he running away ?
and that is the point. that is what people are upset about, i think.
they are releasing irrelevant info that does not affect the case of michael brown is shooting
that is two different arguments.
what they did today was also a good way to taint the jury pool.
how they are giving info that the media asked for.
i believe i read something like ferguson is 29% white but the pd is 94% white.
anybody who uses it at every opportunity falsely weakens the message.
at least they are thorough.
i am relying on details agreed upon by the police and the witnesses.
and you want to make a decision without any hard facts.
autopsy report spoiler alert died from multiple gunshot wounds
then tell me the people of ferguson have not earned some distrust.
this turned out to be a very popular tweet
simple mike brown was inspector gadget.
strongly agree. i know policing is a terribly high-stress job, but most people are not criminals.
it is also pretty upsetting that a kid was summarily executed for maybe stealing a pack of cigars.
no that you see this as a racial situation before you know anything.
you do not want to see what is happening ? fine. keep being naive. good day.
the investigation that officer had a facial injury) .
that is an account from the st co police chief
for you to declare he was executed without any facts is also as absurd.
they have already said he shot him once from the car. christ.
do you not even have a basic understanding why people mistrust police ?
if he was shot in the chest or back is the biggest factor in who is right.
there is a difference between an open mind and an empty one
to have the supreme court declare open season for cops on the population is a deliberate decision.
are you saying they start at the end and do not explain why he was approached by cops ?
right there you just admired they are all bad witnesses if they have distrusts in cops.
p sure you know the answer to that question.
country is just not paying close enough attention. ‚Äú
i am had the suspect been white would the pd have acted the same ?
everyone agrees he was shot once at close range and multiple times at 30+ feet.
why was not arrested if he was suspected of a robbery ?
so no matter that evidence comes out during the investigation that is what you are going with ?
it is i both argued that the supreme court was wrong. . .
and that suppressing or selectively releasing info led to people deciding for themselves.
they have systematically only released information that makes them look good, even info that might taint
an investigative report on the shooting ?
it sure did. a boon to my
agree. not worth the bullets whatsoever.
has that info came out yet ?
perhaps they need to their training.
that right there tells me you are going into this with an agenda.
the surveillance photos , the police report , and this witness account .
the dead body on the street was wearing pants not shorts
is it common to conflate two separate investigations like this ?
why is not locked up ?
the surveillance the police report, and this witness account.
the police many is this punishment for theft ? or ?
is that for sure mike brown though ?
. from how long after ? videotape def not reviewed before brown was killed 10 mind later
am i right in remembering the store owner saying his store was not robbed ?
suspected theft is not cause for an execution in the street
did not mike brown have hair ?
just saying the narrative the race mob has been selling is likely.
please rt before this is taken down ! his clothes do not match

police reports released this morning indicate mike brown was a suspect in a " strong-armed " robbery in
how many times do innocent ‚Äú black men ‚Äú fit the description tho ?
fuck that. where is the report ? why was he unarmed ? no. we demand justice.
old saying there is always two sides to a story ‚Äú
i have not seen anyone say he was black. it is a somewhat common name.
fit description would be more accurate.
attacks leaves per examined
that is there is always a ‚Äú history ‚Äú when the african americans gets killed.
oh yes. clear that something occurred, death still not necessarily the right result.
police reports released this morning indicate mike brown was a suspect in a ‚Äú strong-armed ‚Äú robbery in
it is a little scary to know they shoot and kill people suspected of crimes in ferguson.
tweeted this did 4 days ago. is this the same robbery and market ?
so it was fine to just execute him in the street then
i retract my previous tweet. darren wilson is race is not confirmed. i apologize.
and unfortunately we will never hear the other side of the story because he is dead
wait a i thought they said he was a good boy ?
when he became a suspect upon the firing of the fatal shot ?
so they are claiming a black cop killed ? ?
cops beat man , charged him w/ " property damage " for bleeding on their uniforms . then they lied
whatever happened to being servants of the public ‚Äú ? or ‚Äú protect and serve ‚Äú ?
odd. it‚Äôs a daily beast article. should be fine.
wow. that is ... i do not ... wt ...
here is the i assume that they are running javascript from another website.
that was just a logo on some police cars, has never been the law.
does this work any better -
i wonder if the people of ferguson have grounds for a class action lawsuit against the pd.
that worked. as for the story, it is grim reading.
yes. the while thing is scary.
i direct to a list of fallacies.
it was a st. louis county police officer who shot this man , according to pio brian schellman .
it was a st. county police officer who shot this man, according to pro brian hellman.

thats so fucked someone needs to police the police. this is getting out of hand
do not trust the pigs never trust the pigs will not trust the pigs
trust a pig and their body cam and here is proof !
that is just disgusting action by the police. like to see that play out in court !!
front if his head looks like the back of george zimmerman head does not it.
without knowing anything more than in this article, i must say that is/was ' bucking foul !
arrested with intent to bleed. he should bleed insanity
no words ' rt cops beat a man and charged him with getting his blood on their uniforms
i know this a pretty fucked up but that is some g shit brush

brown suspect in robbery before death ‚Äù suspect in stealing a candy bar
aye is this a peace sign or gang sign ?
we prefer the term american sir
brown suspect in robbery before death
police have named the cop who shot michael brown. is latest report from :
way to flash a gang sign while asking for peace
police have a duty to protect everyone, blacks protect criminals and use the death to make money.
if anyone is curious what cognitive dissonance looks like, examine this bobby news gent.

maybe lord knows i do not watch that shit fox news so maybe the chief does.

how do you ask for something you know nothing about ?

i am just glad that police department is too stupid to cover their shit up right.

so sad. i looked at both pics. it sure looks like him.
well depends on the cigar.
correct. which is why he was not, you ass kiss.
who said it was ?
no one is saying that mr. straw man.
do you understand what i am saying ? how had they already determined was the suspect when the report was
if true i can agree.
i asked the same thing !
once he put his hands up he should not have been shot again.
i saw that too. like are you assuming it was him the same day it happened low
did you shoplift as a kid ?
you do not blend in at 6 ft 4 and 300 pounds.
not justifying what the police did. we need more facts.
yes my brother is his size ....
the words ex post facto ‚Äú come to mind.
so in , robbing a convenience carries the death penalty . got it .
i still can not believe that they are claiming that he pushed the cop back in the car.
so robbing a convenience carries the death penalty. got it.
my sister works at mays. she says white folks stealing all day long. they live
with a nonsensical id to boot. the only thing that made him a suspect was his race.
but not if you are white & amp ; commit robbery in hollywood
so robbed the store then leisurely walked down the street ?
no death penalty was issued by any court.
simply being suspected of robbery carries a death penalty
the press conf makes pd look like they have gone from stonewalling to counter punching . we give up a
exactly since when is jaywalking punishable by death ?
say it again oh never mind, i can just rt it
the first goal is to get a conviction so he can never be a cop again.
since they want to label as a shoplifter, since when is that crime punishable by death ?
i would rather be a than being a now
damn surveillance video we give up a name, we drag his through the mud.
makes them look inept as well.
what is so frustrating is that now we are talking about a robbery and not the killing of an unarmed
that was the intention. misdirection.
why not wait for the investigation & amp ; try your best to be objective.
needs to brown family they are right
criminalizing black the most effective distraction tactic in american history ...
that was their plan amp ; its working with the sheep !!
that is probably the whole point of releasing the video. very sad/devious.
so quit talking about a robbery, stick to the subject
amp that a jaywalking incidence lead to a dead 18 y/o is beyond all understanding.
this is ridiculous.
agreed but it can not be ignored
i am not talking at the robbery. reasonable people know that stealing cigars is not justification 4 execution
this is exactly what the pd & amp ; their pr machine want-focus off their indefensible behavior.
we would rather talk about anything other than a white police officer murdering an unarmed black kid.
: the officer involved in the shooting of michael brown is named darren wilson , police chief says .
this says it all should not be a single voter after this
is he in jail now ? is he going to stand trial ? these are the pertinent questions
the selective release of information by pd tells us nothing about the shooting . instead appears to be a basic
and we expected more from the police force that tear gassed a news van ?
photo rehearsed. disgusting. criminal.
where ever he he is well protected ... they have already circled the surrounding wagons ...
and now the whole world is watching !!! can not sweep this under any rug !
the right wing spin machine is in full damage control.
in 2009 pd beat a black man , then charged him for getting blood on their uniforms
follow me. ill follow back asap. (not spam) !
really come on your saying anything
but the police chief said this sort of thing never happens in guess he is wrong again.
at 8:00 police will release the name of the officer who shot michael brown .

took a week , but we finally at the moment where mike brown is officially a suspect in his own
not always there when it is called but it is always on time
you are a piece of shit.
so in 5mins mike brown shaved his head and changed his scandals to shoes . i think your being lied
the red cap is see other angle
but definitely sandals to footwear
being broadcast on police radio ?? right at the moment ??
cant verify that is him and can change in car
yes. a neutral jury of his peers
i was thinking the same thing !
.... he is actually barefoot
very interesting maybe robbery was done at a different time or a different day
you do not shoot a kid un armed
even if that was brown in the store that doesn‚Äôt mean a cop can just shoot him.
assuming the crown or equivalent approve charges
and where is the red hat from the robbery ?
the riots sure gave us a glimpse of our own loss of freedoms to protest. dd
who shaved his head then 5 min the guy is bald see the glee off his head ???
what other angle .... all i have been the angles you provided
there is no red hat in the pic on left ....
please check these inconsistencies how is it that these inconsistencies are overlooked by ?
also put on long pants & amp ; lost his red hat.
he has a hat on in the surveillance video ... can not see hair
it is him. red cap. but foot ware change happened.
oh , whoops , the robbery had nothing to do with being stopped , but at least now half of
cops are usually too to actually confront for jaywalking unless something suspicious happens after contact.
this is what pd did to in 2009 when they mistook him for a man with an outstanding warrant
you should have posted the incident report along with the photo !
seems these cops think too much & amp ; know too little ...
my god ... what the hell ... bastards !!!
that person that tweeted that to inform people that same pd has a history of being on bull shit
because all black boys look alike and suspect ? of.
get the democrat vote out in and fire the whole police force
this is what pd did to in 2009 when they mistook him for a man with an outstanding warrant
there was no lawsuit for damages ?
i am sure he did nothing wrong and just stood there and took it rights ?
and the black female democratic judge disagreed with the case he presented.
the media did not even know the video existed , but he just said they requested it ? dude .
media knew. talk of a related robbery has been around since the first day.
. how did you learn media did not know of video ?
press conference just now by police chief.
this bullshit is falling off a cliff
same media his cops were ordering away from the military action area and shutting down their communications.
he did not deserve to die. period. this is foolery
can you say cover up ! ‚Äú)
this guy is full of it. i do not trust anyone from that police force.
he could use some mentoring from capt johnson for sure.
please say that on !!!
please stop pretend you did not feel video is terror of store clerk that is not. helping

it is like justifying rape based on the clothes a victim was wearing. nonsense.
admitted not handled right but this large kid was no ‚Äú nice ‚Äú college kid.
f'n cops and stupid people seem to think money and property is more valuable than human life.
black life unfortunately.
when they are black police do not care at all
law allows police to shoot fleeing suspect.
no. we have a court system to try criminal allegations. cops are not judge and jury.
maybe the questions are they worth dying over ‚Äú ?
cigarettes on island. cigars in. are these seriously enough to take a life ?
rt cigarettes on island. cigars in. are these seriously enough to take a life ?
when your brown they really do not even need a complex reason.
police can only shoot fleeing suspect if poses significant threat of death or serious bodily harm.
young brothers have gotta stop doing stupid stuff.
not gone law is not written that way.
i guess our police now define these as dangerous weapons
wow rt : " the initial contact between the officer and mr. brown was not related to the robbery ,
can not wait to see the cop go to trial
i am watching him stumble & amp ; bumble through this questioning.
he admitted the officer stopped for walking in the street-not a robbery.

new development pentagon supplied st. louis county police with military-grade weapons.
always figured someone above was pulling strings
seriously tell us something we do not already know
not a new development. standard across the country. it is the 1033 program.
they supply the entire world with weapons !
you should see land is arsenal
actually now since 1999 the military has been giving ‚Äú all ‚Äú police dept their excess supplies
when did this occur recently or some time ago ?
this has been happening since 1990
new development pentagon supplied st. louis county police with military-grade weapons. ‚Äù brush
i personally do not trust st. louis county pd , and i think they waited all this time to forge
find something oh look he went to a store, let is say he robbed it !
or it could simply be the truth. unfortunately, we will never know for sure.
you never had the correct name of the officer, losing faith in anonomis
a criminal organization should have never been trusted. it was a witch hunt. sickened me.
just admit you got the wrong person man seriously you cocked up
so what about where did his info come from ???
whatever happen to the lost phones what footage was on those ????
is that armed robbery on the police dispatch
want us to believe this . .t.otoope outrage across the country
you guys still doing this ? have not you caused enough trouble with your own piss poor investigation
robbery was over a tobacco product from qt, minutes before.
according to st. news and videos from previous days.
why is my picture as your picture that is creepy !
exactly figuring out a way to spin this shit.
it totally sounds like you are from the st area ....
i am right there with you
or maybe you were just wrong ?
... you followed blindly and believed all his shit. lurk mar and believe less.
lies was not wanted in robbery otherwise his friend would he been considered an accomplice
i make up my own mind.
i heard tin foil hats are on sale at walmart !
yeah and and the tooth fairy are real too
that is certainly what it looks like ...
took time to file sunshine request
well you are trusting a fail fag just cut he has an anon name and avid, so .....

this is troubling because this could have been disclosed in the beginning.
it is but it is not unprecedented as we all know
check this out. very interesting take. .
... and we are all left to wonder why it was not.
we are with police chief thomas jackson
this young man assassinated his own character
things must and will change. tell everyone to get out the vote.
he is caught on camera stealing and assaulting. that is his character

lawyers for police in bad shootings often advise shooters not to write reports or even speak to commanders or investigators
key word bad shooting
in other words lie and cover up.
cigarillo is not a felony.
looking forward to your show this eve.
but robbery and assault is.
and lawyers remind citizens not to talk to the police.
what we do know is that mb had a propensity to get physical with people.
is not that in violation of any procedure requiring termination ?
did not say that. let is wait till investigation is over. how about that novel idea ?
is it illegal for the officer not to fill out a report after he shoots a suspect ?
the police chief confirmed the stop of had absolutely nothing to do with the alleged convenience store robbery .
which is even more alarming for him to gun down
so why was it released ??
to try to convince the public and media he was a violent thug to justify what was done
this pisses me off to a level i can not adequately describe.
the police chief confirmed the stop of had absolutely nothing to do with the alleged convenience store robbery.
. keeps playing the video while saying it has nothing to do with the murder of this is psychological warfae
hired is lawyer mark o mara .... just saying'!!!!
is giving better coverage from what i have been seeing
family of michael brown slams police chief is " devious " attempt to " blame the victim "
the lack from the actual crime in question, yes.
information verification takes time especially when people are rioting. executive witness is alleged accomplice
police always seem to do this when a black person is involved.
not releasing all it in unprofessional manner is deceptive/misleading potential shplftn does not equate with murder
but to say it is devious to release official photographs and police reports is transparency no ?
i think they mean piecemeal.
this information was released conveniently at same time as officer is name. it is called deflection.
not at all. why release information before verifying it is true ? i would be more concerned otherwise
what definitive evidence exists that validates that statement ?
yes. when done in this manner. meaning almost a week later. the timing is suspicious.
family of brown slams police chief is ‚Äú devious ‚Äú attempt to ‚Äú blame the victim ‚Äú
but they did execute him. this is them steering away from that.
releasing official police reports and surveillance footage is devious ?

chief jackson : officer darren wilson stopped initially because he was in the street and blocking traffic .
so not murder that is my point !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ticket able offense not execution worthy !!!!
rt chief officer darren wilson stopped initially because he was in the street and blocking traffic.
if you kill an innocent person you are a criminal and should be handled as such.
but they calling it law enforcement protect and serve. smh
sure ... let is draw attention to ourselves ! ~
you do know i was being sarcastic ?
how about ... we just stop killing innocent people period ? seems easy enough to me.
how do we know that happened ? there are multiple eye witnesses that say otherwise.
it is not working.
do you have a source for that ?
only the ones that people get away with, do to their authority ...
u us covered all grounds then
and how long has innocent blacks been getting killed.
my point was that whole eye for an eye mentality just results in more innocents being killed.
its jaywalking and it is a ticket-able offense
shoot unarmed kid . conceal evidence . impose martial law . harass reporters . smear the victim . worst .
like me mistakenly calling an 18 year old a kid is worse than the other 4 points ?
just think how this story would be if the cop was black and the vic was white
legally yeah he was.
if only they had the balls to say ‚Äú we are sorry ‚Äú
17 is a 18 is an adult. being big has no relevance.
sure. everyone lies but the ‚Äú minority ‚Äú in these situations.
fox news will talk about it now
u win. i am apparently not qualified for lottie of the week anymore. take it back.
for all we it is standard practice.

i am sorry kid ‚Äú, i got no times for bs. peace.
and they think we are buying this bullshit !
here are pix i have.

why should only cops be allowed to have guns again ?
was 17 when he got killed. legally a minor.

i argue that economics and a culture that glamorizes crime have to do with it.
it is robbery if you touch a person in the store.
it is about percentages is all about percentages)
it. for it to be robbery, there must be fear of deadly harm.
now that is funny !
alters brain mood kills memory, brain cells.
this is not remotely what happened in this situation.
walks him down. that is what i see. sorry.
source i meant to post. )
you post one white supremacist website and everybody thinks you are a racist.
after somebody walks out of a store with your shit ? c among.
oh so now we are making up terms to suit murdering an 18-year old for shoplifting.

the negative effects are minimal and manageable if used with caution and care.

i understand why it is used.
you did not find this funny ?

10 reasons to stay away from weed. 8. lower iq. 10. personality changes

and there is a history of problems in ferguson that go beyond one incident.
nope. not a fact. weed causes permanent personality changes and can cause irritably and aggressiveness.
... many gay men are lisping, mincing fairies.
robbery involves a weapon. no weapon shown here.
not paid leave is hard to stomach.
you are one dumb bitch. lol
name calling is a tactic used by right-wingers who have
no it is not. you are obviously not a lawyer.
it‚Äôs enough to commit a robbery if you use any type of force to take property from someone
absolutely. fear of violence does not mean being pushed. give me a break.
you wonder why property values are lower in black neighborhoods ? see earlier statistics.
true. whites are the majority of the population.
we are talking percentages though.
you are more likely to stumble across a criminal by targeting white men.
please. this is what happens when you believe your own eyes ...
do we know why the clerk bothered pursuing him ? why pursue if he paid ?
there is no such animal as a ‚Äú strong-arm ‚Äú robbery.
fact reached for officers gun and wrestled him inside his car ... from the mouth of the witness
it is as real as any mental addiction. it is not physically addictive.
so where in the video is he paying ?
since when since brown was shot ? strong-armed robbery is robbery using a weapon.
this is nonsense. this is why my children need protection from twisted thinking like yours.
we know a cop shot an unarmed 18 year old at least six times.
you watch way too many movies. do not believe every music video you see.
nowhere in any law book does it say robbery involves the threat or application of deadly force.
he paid for the cigars. end of story.
nope. not true. sorry.
he paid for them. why delete that part of the video ???
yeah right. easy to say when the generalizations are not being made about you.
if you are talking about profiling, you are talking about likelihood, that mean is percentages.
sorry. faulty math there.
does not make either one an*whole
store did not report a robbery. did not know why police wanted surveillance footage.
it is an act of violence. so, yes, that is included under force.
you do not like math ?
... cultural values in these communities, reduce drug use and gang influence, and encourage higher education.
he did not walk into the store and threaten the clerk either.
i have known plenty of potheads that function just fine and are active, intelligent people.
he was a criminal. stop overlooking the facts ...
great. see you in court.
robbery is theft using threat of deadly force.
you are an idiot and a racist ! lol
of course conveniently pd deletes the part of the video that shows he paid for them ...
gunned down an unarmed man. the reason matters little.

psychology today marijuana addiction is real |
it is robbery once something is taken.
go prove me wrong.
you said the threat of deadly force is required. it is absolutely not.
there are more white people. but that is irrelevant to the point i am making.
what are you talking about ?
10. people are nicer on weed. fact.
i have never pushed a clerk.
only police have said eyewitnesses have not. police have confirmed he was unarmed-that is 1 constant fact
he walked up to the register. there does not seem to be any altercation at the counter.
suppositions you mean like the ones you are making ?
using this as evidence for the brown case is a logical fallacy called ' faulty generalization. '
... okay ...)
actually it is a word used when dealing with a racist.
great. this entire exchange started over my comment about using black-on-black crime as a subterfuge.
your info from
all of the experts agree it causes the motivational syndrome and decreases memory ...
clerk pushed him first. does that make him an*whole ?
sad yes. unfair absolutely. logical ? well. yeah.
since there are more white people and they commit the majority of crime ...
meanwhile jams shoots 82 people in aurora and is taken alive ...
i would hope you are a hot mess.
does not mean that is what happened. we do not know what happened.
my point is if someone pushes you, expect to be pushed back
picture on top shows the robbery. called a strong arm robbery, and it is a felony
where did police suggest that ? what a fucking cunt.
sorry. i know better than this. the lies do not work with me.
the war on drugs increased all incarcerations significantly.
sorry you need to tell this to someone who has not seen the opposite first hand.
except for the 9-1-1 bombers had european passports, dyed hair and did not look middle eastern.
you really are not very good with deciphering our giving meaning to statistics
sorry. devaluation came before crime.
it is a robbery the second you touch an employee. w/out weapons it is strong arm robbery.
but he did not walk into the store and shove the clerk.
the way to fix this is to stop stripping the wealth from black communities
disproportionately property values are devalued in black communities, disproportionately black incomes are predominately less
thats like saying i know plenty of alcoholics that function just fine.
racist the word idiots use when they lose an argument.
admitted it. brown violently shoved the clerk. end of story.
much of it has to do with economics.
not for legalizing marijuana at all. sorry.
black men tend to be more likely to live in poverty.
actually it is very pertinent. try this one. it gets to the point quicker ...
you can not suppose from that any greater propensity for crime. sorry.
the answers are all there in the statistics. all you need to do is think about them.
fact admitted to robbing store. (that is a fact) .
i am not retweeting the pic of is body , but evidently he lost the hat and changed his shoes
it is because to white cops we all look alike.
i am not smearing. i am portraying his past demeanor like they are with the ferguson police dept
which we do not even have confirmation actually happened. the gas station said nobody stole anything.
but it is to smear the cop that is alive without due process ? honest question.
lost his too.
my gangster was with a real shotgun and i was 17.
post lies research first makes you look dumb
you know all black people look the same * eye roll *
and aged quite a bit. maybe he was a time traveler ?
all in the span of 9 minutes. in broad daylight.
looks like the same person in these pics to me ?
fact . we know more about how allegedly stole cheap cigars than how and why a police officer shot and
curious ... is not it ?
can not steal if they in a bag
this is why cops should have to wear live stream go pros
police once beat a man then charged him with destruction of property for bleeding on their uniforms
it is sad when real headlines read like the. pd needs and overhaul !

i thought this was tongue in cheek or something from the onion when i first read it.

update : police release stills from convenience store footage showing robbery
justice for the police dept. they were doing their job & amp ; protecting your sorry butts.
thanks for that. i want to see photos if they were taken. they should have been.
release of the dispatch recordings might come out as well.
i am looking for his read hat and his flip flops can you find them ?
you do a lot of bitching and whining, but never make any points.
they killed thugs are thugs whatever color they are.
are you justifying the murder of an unarmed adult ?
check your facts and the pics from what he was wearing when he was gunned down, sh
gentle right. go arrest that partner he had too.
is still alive. so is the guy who shot a congresswomen in az.
then what is the relevance ?
i did not head you üëÇ
i said teen not child but again, how is the pic relevant ?
if the officer did his job he would be arrested not murdered. still the point.
good folk of support your police dept., riot against the thugs in your town.
he was not a an adult who was robbing a business.
you are one sick stupid person.
update police release stills from convenience store footage showing robbery
still unclear in the context of the shooting of an unarmed teen. but ok.
good piece of evidence to bad the officer was still wrong for murdering a strong armed robbery
he is large. in the store photos you have some prospective unlike the still photos.
you are a peter piper follower. monkey see, monkey do.
are there reports of the officer receiving injuries ?
read my heading. i do not concern myself with your opinion. your a sheep.
are you really justifying the murder of an unarmed kid ? o
oh well that just justifies everything does not it.
are you afraid of admitting you are a racist ? are you afraid of being called a racist ?
this is mike brown stop lying and get your facts straight next time you insult another humans life
i have not but i just think it turns into a said he/she said without them.
you are one sick racist bitch
what point are you making about the photo ?
was not mike brown wearing pants, and shoes ?
they killed them self.
this proves what rt update : police release stills from convenience store footage showing robbery

so police can afford machine guns but they can not afford dash cameras for their squad cars ?
thought it was that they had purchased them but never installed them.
so they can not afford to open them ?
that is crazy. they did not seem as disorganized when it came to preparing for the riots.
ha. the stakes are higher.
they at least bothered to take the machine guns out if the box.
not sure about i read it was just a matter of laziness / disorganization / carelessness.
they have them but they are still in boxes
so they could not afford to open and install them ?
video cameras on patrol cars to make video/ camp ; audio recording of contact with the public/or suspect
with the 1033 rifles probably cost less than body cams.
they are protecting and serving themselves. clearly not
protecting and right
darren wilson is a six year veteran of the police and had no disciplinary actions against him .

we wait with bated breath.
all these post and clean up. is it possible to bring back ??
it is too late we already know who he is
funny how they are releasing after only after anonymous already hacked and tweeted the real name of the officer

he looks exactly how i imagine that entire police force looks : fat, white and completely incompetent.
that guess was wrong. it is darren wilson.
how the hell do you work somewhere and do not know the people hate your ass ? lies smdh
that was my mistake. tillman was the man standing over him.
i refuse to call the police chief incompetent when it is so clear the release of that video was calculated
nods everything been on purpose and right on time
sage words my fellow professor.
exactly. they merely appear that way.
you do not have to be competent to be malicious
he is an incompetent that is for sure.
they not a bunch of bumbling elmer funds.
breaking news : according to documents released to the press , was connected to an earlier robbery
i have a real civil rights idea that will work.
these pictures look but stealing rills does not justify murder !
did not the manager of the store already say this was not true
lies was not wanted 4 robbery otherwise his friend would he been considered an accomplice ...
that still is no excuse to kill him
there is a million dudes wearing cargoes & amp ; white tees everyday please stop
all i see is him walking in a store
this guy is way fatter than mike
breaking news according to documents released to the press, was connected to an earlier robbery
he stole a candy bar and was threatened the cops will come to resolve the issue
of you have to crop have his face.
so , to sum up : 1 ) darren wilson knew nothing of the robbery , 2 ) shot over
so he should have been shot ten times ? that narrative is in doubt via the eyewitnesses.
and did not write his own incident report
this story just keeps exponentially devolving.
and on paid vacation courtesy if taxpayer.
the robbery that was not a robbery. . . huh.
police in plan to release name of officer who shot unarmed teen michael brown :
that is a really stupid announcement by the ferguson police
the man in

they do not have a choice under mo law

now everyone gonna go after him
and the sad thing is he is probably already half away around the country in the witness protection
i hope they do not. until we know the facts why put his life in jeopardy.
they are waiting for him to go into hiding before they release his name.
. hope they convict him.

do not forget he shoved someone. i am sure that justifies it ...
sign and share time to end police militarization now !
the info given today seems to line up with this witness account , even the alleged theft :
how did get way across town on foot in 2mins the time line do not add up sh
please interpret that for us white people. sub titles maybe.
. as suspect should have been made public much earlier-todays pd report = legal tactic as i said
and his body was not place in an ambulance
i just call them the way i see them. ‚Äù
still do not justifiable to shoot a man several times !!
this video proves nothing. we will see wants the store video and victim of store speaks
... all the truth actually comes out .
i remember watching this video on monday.
saw this a few days ago. glad you tweeted it.
news says suspect pushed employee when asked to pay for cigarillos.
seems like the two incidents are independent of each other and not connected as might be concluded.
piecing together an excuse for executing a teenager, it is disgusting. all involved need investigating.
shoplifting and assault. strong arm would be pushing the employee to obtain the items, no ?
i just call them the way i see them.
once you push an employee it is strong-arm robbery.
i still do not hear that kid saying they stole them.
this is devastating. he still did not deserve to die.
we will see it does look like him kinda
is the friend in the video in the photos the police have ?
it was him that shopped lift
finger print of the officer gun which is hard to take out a holder
regardless even if did alleged) the price 4 any scuffle should not be being murdered by cops
says the cashier did not call police. is there a tape of the 911 call ?
the info given today seems to line up with this witness account, even the alleged theft :
that logo on his hat and shoes will tell all. and the store victim
2 for that is robbery ? even 6 packs do not run u 10.
also lines up pretty well with the witness hsbc spoke with last night.
he says if was not quick trip. and i hear ferguson market says he paid.
yea i am really confused on that part of the video as well ...
michael brown did not steal anything !!!!! it has just been reported that he did not steal anything
what station are you watching ?
can i ask where this info is from ?
those people unfortunately will find a reason to justify the death regardless
get used to it ... read
brown did not steal anything !!!!! it has just been reported that he did not steal anything
you were there ? ‚Äù * blocks *
there is no justification for gunning him down in the street.
thank you very much. i appreciate it ! stay well !!
i know that. i was just adding to your disgust.
you stupid the irony .... move along
this fucking city will burn if it does
why did they shoot him ?
she is an ignoramus and can not argue intelligently so she just blocks people. typical
men on the rise ‚Äú
you were there
thank you i will dig into it
you are an incredibly stupid human being.
that tweet was directed towards the racist trolls trying to use that lie as a justifiable reason for execution
nearly 7k blacks were murdered last yr -- almost all by other blacks . a tiny % were unarmed-killed-by-cop .
black on black crime is not what feeds them.
cops need to be held to a higher standard.
mo is black and had no homicides all year until mike brown.
there is no money in black on black crime.
1,800 plus black babies aborted a day. no one hates blacks like other blacks.
how many of those blacks that killed blacks avoided prosecution ?
no no no $$$, for race hawkers !
there is no in it for them.
yet the lotus wants for illegals.
i do not believe that was his ‚Äú point ‚Äú at all.
i am not believing this story because i know how the police lie and will keep lying and will organize
they just new he needed better than ‚Äú he went for my gun ‚Äú, so this bullshit.
look at the stills. it was brown. still does not justify shooting.
even if it is constitution says he has a right to a fair trial, not execution
police chief : the initial contact between and was not related to the alleged theft of cigars .
do you have reference thank you.
w. t. f. why did they bring it up then ?! a-holes.
so then there was no reason he killed him. that is a better story ?
. seems they are having trouble getting their stories straight. wonder why ?
yo rt police chief the initial contact between and was not related to the alleged theft
so why release the robbery information first
so it even begs the ?? more now, why bother releasing that info today ?
. we all knew but it is nice he admits it.
officer in shooting death of michael brown was unaware he was a suspect : police
that all smells at bullish ...
truth u. seals to 911 @ home. police judges prison guards
know bull ‚Äú when they hear it !
maybe this explains why he attacked the officer. he thought he was going to get arrested.
in the heat of the night, thought the same thing
dam that police chief looks like carol o'conner
that is why they kept him under wraps : the subterfuge continues in !
botched pr jobs by made matters worse, brown was killed for no reason.
send these super cops to iraq. & amp ; russia bring home our real soldiers !
officer in shooting death of michael brown was unaware he was a suspect : police
key point : officer wilson was not aware that was a robbery suspect . it will be key in establishing
insurance covers a building and the goods inside.
he was saying it was a different store ...
new that he had just committed a serious crime. that is key in establishing state of mind.
police report says clerk indicated the suspect left and walked towards quick trip.
me just saying the situation is bad in many ways.
witness from the video admitted brown was there. that much i did not misunderstand low
wait for lawyers to help write verbiage ... but that is just what i recall, could be wrong
i mean witnesses. did anyone hear wilson say anything ?
from what i understand the fbi has taken over
what to tell the guy says it clearly. just says brown was not stealing.
i saw it yesterday. and talked to people who spoke to him
that is what i understood
by writing the he would be providing evidence against himself.
based on history over last 5 year is, and that area. he gets (cont)
just have a judge died society ?
watch again. you heard wrong
and as we have seen already. this police force is very (cont)
hey is was not at practice today.
5th but that is why there is no legal statement / account about anything ...
that is what i but this guy says brown was in the car
i believe the witness accounts heard 7+ ... 7 bullets needed for a kneeling unarmed 18 yr old ?
it is a bad situation in many ways. other innocents affected.
the cop shot out the car at mr. brown, then got out car and shot again
dash cams still have do they not ? everyone in court i have seen has
they do not have satellite imagery of everywhere. thats physically impossible.
if you can get them to cover all the loss. they will nickel and dime away.
i am not sure 5th applies to police reports. pretty sure they are required to write incident report
especially if he did nothing wrong ... why would not he writes it and give his story while fresh
every single witness account is exact same. only different 1 is the cop
the witness accounts i have read all say the same thing. only different one is the cops
that is the problem ... this pd was already under federal investigation for shit like this.
if the feds could burial the entire us and world, there would never be any fugitives.
then why did that officer have contact
and i am happy for you that you have not been exposed to this during your lifetime
i misunderstood it. no struggle, but brown was in the police car at one point.
yea but i see how i misunderstood
but that is me. if i am wrong then i can live with that.
you have not been following the news lately. police do go around shooting kids for no reason
5th amendment rights did not file paperwork either
5th amendment. he has the right to not provide evidence against himself.
so you do admit an unarmed kid was shot right ? and fled from where ?
even if it was a franchise ... or is qt different ?
and that statement really just hurt my heart, and i am (cont)
not following why that is important ?
i watched that ... absolutely crazy shit
before this already under fed investigation for racial profiling / brutality etc.
so y'all saying 2 different stories. looking at same video ?
maybe i am having trouble understanding him
so why did he stop him ?
me mentioned a knee not sure how serious
well either way it had nothing to do with the shooting, so it is irrelevant
so i instead of chasing someone for a jay walking citation (cont)
would not open. but i saw 2 witnesses that said different
he is not and will not speak. police department and lawyers made sure of that
police report has zip code of robbery as 63135. only quick trips in the area are 63136
it could just be smoke ‚Äú / lame attempt to shift focus from murder to robbery.
did anyone mention anything the cop, wilson, might have said as to why he shot him ?
this lady says in the video the police took down security cameras where mike brown was shot
who did not even write the incident report of his version of accounts
if the guy got shot and fled, where did the dead body come from ?
yea police chief admitted did not know about the robbery.
cop shot while in car. got out. mr. brown then went to knees, shot again
was there seen in video, identified as dorian johnson.
would not be so bad if they were not already under federal interest cases
it takes 7 days to release a coroner is report ... nowhere in (cont)
where did the robbery happen ?
clearly says he was at ferguson market ...
this is the witness that said that
try opening in a browser ...
farmer is market is 63135

i would hope the department has some sort of protocol to keep them safe.
any background on this mike brown ??
i hope they protect his family.
he will be dead by monday. their version if mourning = violence.
the police chief just basically confirmed was gunned to death for the crime of walking in the street ? horrific
wrong. the violent assault committed makes it more likely he attacked the cops minutes later.
but ... there was something leading up to the shooting ? or what ?
that is not what i heard at all. what is your source and quote ?
every time the police talk , their story changes . i hate it .

reminder : forget the robbery , forget the minor looting . nothing justifies militarized police pointing sniper rifles at journalists
nothing justifies militarized police pointing sniper rifles at anyone
poor and the homeless are not royalty.
new bill stop militarizing law enforcement act drafted yesterday
minor looting did not they burn down a store ?
except cocktails. cocktails justify snipers ...
oh yea the cocktails too.
or pointing any weapon at any non-combatant
basically pd did an opposition research dump on mike brown , and not their jobs
exactly. as they always do.
opposition research is for bloggers.
were brown amp his friend in this store
basically pd did an opposition research dump on mike brown, and not their jobs
we have just witnessed the fox versification of an entire police department
because law enforcement officers and political bloggers are exactly the same thing ?
let is not forget that even if mike brown did shoplift , that is not why police said he was
noticed they said robbery and not shoplift.
alleged use of force to allegedly push store person make it robbery and not shoplifting.
then there'z the jaywalking ... ‚Äú : noticed they said robbery and not shoplift. ‚Äù
according to their initial report brown initiates contact. now the cop stopped him as a potential suspect ?
so still the police officer should be charged with 1st degree murder. nothing changes that
alleged use of force to allegedly push store person make it robbery and not shoplifting
i am all for truth and transparency. how what happened at store vilify cop shooting brown ?
so police narrative in is unarmed teen suspected in unarmed robbery was shot to death . we have still got
picture of robber shows a weapon
so shooting an unarmed black teen in cold blood b/c he could be a robbery suspect is ok ?
case in court will likely turn on that piece of narrative
your little narrative is unraveling. that tends to happen when you jump to conclusions.
the conclusion that was jumped to was made by officers when they shot mb. (cont)
i explain why on my tl
cops beat this man ‚Äì then charged him for getting blood on their uniforms
really pulling up a case from 6 years ago ? you can do that anywhere
why do not people ever tell the whole story ?
you write this without even reading the full story.
did he sue the police force ?
we need to stop all the non sense. it is about michael brown r i p#üôåüôåüôå
how bout stop writing about it and pick up a gun like them
wow. something has to be done.
our world is broken.
you are joking about this right ?
all we want is justice and that cop in jail
the case is still active. my guess is there are plenty more.
civil suit. got it. lose the shitty attitude.
cops beat this man then charged him for getting blood on their uniforms
and i assure they did this for absolutely no reason, right ? this is pathetic ‚Äú journalism ‚Äú
nothing to do with this case. just fanning the flames.
increasingly seems like police dept . spent all week playing dress-up , could not even be bothered to get its
when did shoplift became robbery.
do you actually report anything accurately jaywalking ? he was a suspect in a strong arm robbery
just like a guilty criminal.
that is because there was no feasible reason for dude to kill him ... police brutality pure and simple
this could be the inspiration for that ' let is be cops ' movie.
remarkably , despite the military-style police presence in , a known killer was able to skip town
but assault has yet to be established
can find him either under a white cone hat or a koch bed !
despite the police presence in, a known killer was able to skip town
watch this girl lie through her teeth at 4:47
i understand his reluctance have his family around the violence, but they should know where he went.
please take no offense to my analogy. is like something from wouldeliverance.
and you are basing your assessment on what ? her statement seems to match other witnesses.
the best literary novel first/sentence/like tweet ever
that is why you were not given his name, so that he could skip town.
says what media you choose to believe. you may want to ask how he feels about that statement
plausible that the wilson in fleeing. psychological tests for cops should be mandatory.
" police in , once charged a man with destruction of property for bleeding on their uniforms while four of
john once shot a man for snoring. your move.
that is disgraceful. once again that infamous word ‚Äú allegedly ‚Äú is used for non-black people.
this is some crooked shit. ‚Äú : ‚Äù
msnbc is literally reporting that police chief clearly said it was about jay walking . this is a fucking clown
because he was walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic. that was it. ‚Äù
fox said the same thing ... you know it is bad when they can not even form logical excuse
first , was accused of shoplifting . now , it is a robbery ? it is very telling how the
and a strong arm robbery at that. at a different store.
did he ever say was a suspect ? it just sounds like he was profiled and improperly approached.
we knew the of mike brown was inevitable ....
and a cover up is a cover up !!
breaking - is police chief has announced darren wilson as the cop who shot and killed . ( not the
do you see how desperately they are trying to connect mike brown to a strong armed ' robbery ?
so anonymous is another branch of the cia like i said
and here we go with the suspect negro is stealing stories.
yes he that meant is hiding something ...
i do not trust people i can not see talk to or meet
what do you think of all the pics with the police in the crowd
should be very careful about relying on ‚Äú allies ‚Äú
what do you think the outcome is gonna be flex ?
i wonder if members of will give up their anonymity to apologizing to the guy they falsely accused.
total the people are not down with them like that
every black man fits the description.
govt is already lost trust. it is suspicious to the point of trivialness.
strong armed robbery
it is different anonymous accounts. i think they all are different hackers that use the anonymous name.
even if they were wrong on this one. i still back 100%.
did you see how he was delivering the news ???
show his face and have mike brown is friend identified it
anonymous named the wrong guy ? do you have a link ?
did not i say that. i was fishy about the,. they trolling.
oh no ... he better be careful .... people are pissed ... pray for peace
careful brother careful that is the type of talk that got us in this predicament in the first place
armed robbery in connection with a police shooting a black man ... wow.
that has nothing to do with anything that we are talking about
in what world do you let a cop who killed someone leave town ?
brilliant lets arrest the entire police force for aiding and abetting.
in what world do you let a cop who killed someone leaves town ?
she has a valid concern. you offer a grossly exaggerated red herring in order too ...?
in they killed 1000 is and still free
i said the exact same thing ! lady told me officer was prob. checking in. hahahahahahahahaha !
vacationing on the buddy i‚Äôd imagine.
. in a world where white cops who murder shoplifting kids are free of responsibility for their actions.
a. in a white privilege world
same one where ppm r rioting and that are making death threats to him
i think you know the answer to that one.
when is the police chief being relieved ? he allowed the alleged cop who killed leave town !
in a valid world like ours. where criminals are victims ...
when you place him in the whiteness protection program.
kkk already raising money for the police officer who shot and killed -

it is. 5 map says 11 minute walk
you the fucking brush
he was probably athletic and quick. do not judge a book by its cover
are you all calling him un athletic for making that far with sandals, sh
i am saying it is unlikely to run that far in sandals.
he never played football because he did not like hitting ppm. what the fuck idiot
bombshell : chief says the police officer might not have even known about the robbery when he shot and killed
i agree. i think it is good to know just how blatantly the cops are lying.
is telling these guys how to run pr ? this is horrible
so why release the robbery police report ?! just to slander the dead ?
then that is ok, right ? holy fucking jeeves.
. is not calling that a ‚Äú‚Äù projecting opinion in to your reporting ?
needs to fire literally all of them
would not be have heard in on his radio ?
who knows what and whom to believe but it sure looks like murder to me.
so since we now know the officer knew nothing abt a robbery , we must ask why those tapes were
yes we do to smear his image. get people to say see he was dangerous, etc
not just guns.
to taint the jury if they are forced to charge wilson.
you are right would only take one for me
sit down and shut up stupid
because the press asked for it
does the bullet count matter ? he still took someone is life.
. attacking brown is character to confuse the public and win the pr war ?
it is a distraction. and why did not the pd call in the shooting ?

kids can be pretty brave thinking they can not be touched. no respect for the law.
so a large negro robbed a store and then the cops saw a large negro . what were they supposed
then perhaps he should not have tried to get the cops gun. but thanks for playing.
which only calls your perception into question.
i i tweeted in support of your point, sorry if it did not sound that way
you have found a level of evidence below hearsay. garbled, confused, context-less.
except my tweets are not ‚Äú fo-fucky ‚Äú, as far as i can tell.
murdered. the struggle with the officer can not possibly justify it.
this was a smear so right wingers can justify mike brown is murder.
obviously you can not recognize who holds the same position as you. sorry for you !
here is the epitome of your position. guilty, no need to be proven anything :
are they saying that it is him or that it just looks like him
beat the cop has not been proven at all-it is claimed by the police
no but i did miss the part where the punishment for shoplifting or assault is death
the chief said nothing in his original statement about officers responding to a robbery. nothing.
as i do not yet know all the facts, i do not have a position.
calling someone a fool while siding with ppm chanting death w/o trial, jury judge
stories they are a changing :
kind of my but yeah.
you you do not know what lynch means to black americans. cc :
and right on ask if these allegations ‚Äú change everything. ‚Äú
miss the part where he beat the cop ?
anytime you attack someone with a gun, it is a very likely outcome.
oh sorry was not aware they found a gun on mike brown is person (source plus)
the same police whose story keeps changing & amp ; who have been already proven to be liars
here is a credible eyewitness account.
miss the part where 3 separate witnesses say he was unarmed with his hands up ?
you still seem to be having a hard time getting ' attacking an officer ‚Äú that is hardly shoplifting
name games chuck really ?. banana-banna- (well, you know
no prob. 140 chars makes clarity difficult at times
guessing reading is not your thing here is a did you need to see :
please no more death chants. no reason to stoop to this.
michael brown is the 17 yr old boy who was shot 10x & amp ; killed by police in today
was 18 and assaulted a police officer.
i meant mm not nypd report, but point taken.
does not excuse that he was shot ten times. ten. to protect what ? the candy ?
he is a young boy.
was this boy over six feet and around 200lbs ?
that is cable right ?
child killed to protect candy should be the headline
i just do not understand jumping to conclusions and turning everything into a race war.
pointing out the double standard between how black and black violence is barely reported am not screaming racism
people bring up race because race issues are a major problem these days.
even if that is the case, it does not warrant 8 bullets in your back.
two shots fired outside police car. where is the eight bullets in your back ?
for most marginalized gaps in nyc. try reporting gay domestic violence in bed study.
i agree. i consider it excessive force.
i am not sure how that matters, he is still underage
he is not a boy. racist
what matters here is the reaction. this has brought a lot of racially-motivated events to light.
it is not some leftist conspiracy to make black people seem less violent.
if it happened how else would a shot be fired inside a police car ?
chief let most of day go by b4 disclosing ( after repeated qs ) that cop who killed knew nothing
and it is down right disrespectful to the young man and his family.
seems like there is sewed much about this case it gets confusing yet there is not enough info ??
sad that happened to you. no doubt there are racist/ignorant cops. but not all, maybe not
not necessarily. but it might show a particular disposition towards authority figures.
it is a strategy to manipulate media and misinform people.
that is unfortunate. pd
shoving a clerk means you will take on a police officer with a gun ?
and who would blame them when those authority figures are gunning surrendering suspects down ?
yep splitting image in everything except one has black hair and other blonde ....
have to show mike without clean hands somehow.
for that reason media should refrain from connecting the two. stay with the shooting story.
i had no idea that was her mom.
that is what i thought too ...
did of release the report filed by wilson ?
but she is very good at instigating and baiting .... just like her mother. smh
is he the confirmed robber ?
the people responsible for killing should not be in control of the evidence proving what happened.
it is about changing the narrative.
i re listened to the press cone & amp ; ur right i was wrong
look at his arrive time on the report . this man was still in the store . exlplain this .
this. this. thank you.
this shit says they arrived at 11:54 .... and departed at 6:54 ??
a racist and a murderer will both lie to cover their crimes ...
damn fine policing by the police to identify, broadcast and apprehend the suspect in 10 minutes
exactly. mt look at his arrive time on the report. exlplain this. ‚Äù
please view amp rt original tweet
told that they did take cigarillos, but stopped them for j walking !
this. this, this, this. thank you. ‚Äù ‚úä
this post helps to prove an admission of guilt and revenge
those are often off in surveillance tapes
please view and rt original tweet
police : video shows michael brown strong-arming store clerk
otherwise it is called murder.
that is my we judge without knowledge.
such a nice college bound boy.
i would wait for the facts before calling someone an executioner ....
yeah. its a much safer bet to attack a cop, instead of stepping onto sidewalk.
not just a also a strong arm thug.
multiple times and in retreat.
you think mike brown confessed while they were (allegedly) fighting ? or after he got shot ?
now that part is self interested. cya
police video shows brown strong-arming store clerk
because the chief says he did not know and the interaction was about walking in the street.
by not believing everything the media spouts ? lol
does not warrant shooting but raises the tension between officer and citizen that can lead to tragedy
how bad an attitude warrants being shot ?
not a lot of rockets science going on with that decision.
it may reflect his attitude when he fought with the police.
police chief said he did not know.
are not you doing the same thing but on the other side of the issue ?
honestly. i have seen worse during a barney is shoe sale.
i would but you can not trust the police. the profession is corrupt.
nice to see an idiot who thinks he knows the answers before all the facts come out.
how do you know is hands were up ?
police chief says he released the robbery video because he was getting foia requests for it . how did anyone
must have leaked it to fox
i think he means in the last few hours. fastest response to a foil request ever.
i know was foiling for anything related to the case.
i agree. i hope for justice but i am not holding my breath.
same here. justice system is fucked in this country.
someone needs to do a foil for those foil requests
as i dash cams were not on whatever ‚Äú budget ‚Äú they had ...
yeah the police department seems really strapped for cash
i am requesting the dash cam video from the patrol car of. darrin wilson.
c among they grow up ..... hurry .... please !
if is indeed the robber , where‚Äôs the red ball cap ? sandals ? stolen cigars ?
did not say he was wearing sandals+could not run from police
he was being sarcastic. chill and leave me out of this please.
shut ! you are cramping our style ! signed, ferguson pd
none of this justifies the shooting or killing, just answering the question. )
red ball cap was in the street. sandals probably came off. check out the socks.
back to my initial tweet ... what does that have to do with it
if he took cigarillos or not does not change the fact mike brown was executed in street
i saw pix of red cap somewhere in footage and pix of scenes ... was away from body
and the loss of at least 20 pounds in less than 10 minutes
go be bitchy somewhere else.
footage of mike brown there was no ambulance at all to get his body.
they panicked because of the witnesses so they forgot to plant the evidence or could not plant it.
tragic that authorities stoop to such depths-shameful.
if is indeed the where‚Äôs the red ball cap ? sandals ? stolen cigars ?
cigars are worth more than a human life. that sucks
rt if is indeed the robber, where‚Äôs the red ball cap ? sandals ? stolen cigars ?
they showed it lying in the street on the news
. wear your best i ‚ù§Ô∏è surveillance teeinterntnl wave at surveillance day tomorrow
well i think we vs all hopefully agree that releasing this info about stolen cigars was completely useless.
facts would be releasing info about the killing, not an entirely different crime.
means sarcasm genius. your misplaced anger and self righteousness needs to be put in check.
... and if then why has not dorian been arrested ?
. that is what i want to know lisa.
in the street where i will wait
lawyer says that brown is friend confirms that he did take the cigarillos (via. msnbc)
oh absolutely. not arguing that !
what am i missing. what statement came out today
where is the witness calling 911 ?
the " robbery " incident report released by pd today is sketchy at best . what stood out ? naming
because they have been working on it for the past 5 days !
right being that the date & amp ; time on the report is before the incident sh.
i was wondering about that. the report is author seemed shockingly certain it was him.
can you send me a link, please ? i did not see that.
fox 2 news and you will see the article and the report link to click on.
police chief says was stopped because he was walking in road not because he was suspected of stealing cigars .
has no bearing in a court of law.
they could not seem transport his body in an ambulance. they put it in a suv
and robbery still does not justify shooting an unarmed person w/ their hands up
because it is not relevant to ques of why cop shot camp ; killed brown
but he was a thug .... ok.
yea. not sure how u shoot somebody surrenders 8x.
you can not bring someone into understanding that does not want to understand
the delay and the piecemeal trickle (of unrelated events, even) concerns me
i have legal background. it is immaterial to the shooting.
a video of him robbing a store and his friend admitting it is all fake ?
you cannot enter into facts of case a fact you did not know at the time
i agree that was fucked up.
so he was shot for jaywalking ?
two days another cop shot an unarmed dude in la. shit is getting outta hand
away wit this. it is extremely sad
i am not saying he deserved anything but you can just dismiss him robbing a store.
this is the real issue irish. thank you.
that is what is making ppm more mad. they did not follow any protocol in this case
it is different now he is not just some innocent teen like he has been portrayed.
as far as i it was unmarked. thought it was procedure to have an ambulance
you are right but assaulting someone while stealing is robbery
i agree but you have no clue that they were. only witness is his robbing buddy.
it is not. it shows this thug is state of mind.
could the have been a coroners ' vehicle ? could not tell from picture.
agreed but we must recognize the tactics of the opposition to counter them correctly.
he was not portrayed as innocent. parents pointed out his earlier probe
shoplifting does not give any cop the right to play judge, jury, & amp ; executioner
the issue is militarization of our police. race certainly comes into play.
i bet you can buddy. but i am the racist. what if this was your shop ?
def should have tried to save him or at least taken him in an ambulance.
proof of the slavery of usa no right, to walk on the very thing, designed for travel
congrats on your tweet !
that is what america just reported too. so why did wilson shoot mike brown ?
it only makes sense. they do not like they idea of em being caught abusing authority
theft amp robbery are two different things.
they need to get the story straight. either way he did not deserve what happened to him.
smells of a bad cover up job
exactly. none of it makes sense & amp ; nothing they can justify they outcome
i why who worked as hard as brown did 2 get 2 college would jeopardize that w/robbery
who cares about your background ? i have common sense. he was a thug.
there was absolutely wrong doing and we are all smart enough to see its not right
police chief has said officer did not know of robbery. immaterial 2 shooting
the issue is police brutality.
which again goes to a cop abusing his authority. u do not shoot anybody w/ hands up
misdirection. these guys are magicians.
so many loose ends and unanswered questions. does not engender trust in alleged facts.
but hey here is a bunch of information on an alleged robbery. oh, no reason.
here is the other side.
when our son started we put cams in our car cut cops here harass teens
while you are doing why not acknowledge that it is not ok to rob stores.
come out saying he was alleged ‚Äú strong arm robbery ‚Äú suspect. they must think we are stupid
and fuck your race baiting. i treat everyone as equals.
contradicts what was said in televised presser where indicated cop was not aware of robbery when stopped brown
but i would give you zero sympathy. i have never said it was justified.
several witnesses to shooting say he had hands up
what do you mean ' if ' ? there is pictures and his friend admitted it.
why does everyone just dismiss it like it is no big deal to rob a store ?
as someone with a legal background, that is poppycock
rt : over 50 people have been arrested in . none of them is the cop who shot that boy
an investigation is still ongoing ? holy shit people are dumb
media say group of people protesting for justice ‚Äú it says ‚Äú rioting domestic terrorists ‚Äú
stop playing judge and jury for 5 seconds and find a place to buy a clue.
he was not shot ten times. stop making the independent media look bad.
as you are part of the problem.
oh . so now the police chief says the cop did not know about the robbery when he stopped .
it is a conniving way to do a smear campaign. darren wilson is a cold-blooded murderer.
if u watch the he reached over counter, still not grounds to shoot him from behind
may be prudent to ask clerk if brown was the one who hit him
their account is getting worse and worse roland
was not it just this morning they were saying it was the reason
i hear but u said the wishers were behind the counter and they were, no biggie
but found out about the robbery during the altercation
so that was mike in the convenience store ?
suspicion of a crime results n death of the unarmed in the comm as a rule.
before his death told his mother , " the world will know who is ! "
before his death told his mother, ‚Äú the world will know who is ! ‚Äú
gonna call a big probably not ‚Äú on that one.
it sounds a little made up
before his death told his mother, ‚Äú the world will know who is ! ‚Äú ‚Äù
sounds like something someone who was on a kamikaze mission would say.
meaning i can not imagine anyone outside of a movie saying such a thing.
seriously i doubt it. maybe more likely, ‚Äú i love ya comma ‚Äú.
prayers out to mya , hu graduate who was shot while protesting in st. louis !
is back to the 50s would turn in his grave heading about this.
why release the report about the robbery if it is not related to the contact with the cop who shot
this amateur cop needs to be relieved of his duty and someone competent and impartial take over this investigation
mike brown knew that he was a suspect.
request re all related to case.
they should have released it monday.
sign and share to end police militarization now !
it demonstrates a pattern of aggressive behavior.
i think we know why ... gotta poison the well
excellent question. i think we know the answer.
it might have shown the mental state he was in when he came in contact with the policeman.
the only criminals i have seen in all this coverage are wearing uniforms and talking into microphone.
it is the racial profiling equivalent of slut shaming in rape cases
but it is related. it shows what kind of fucked up person was he deserved it. idiots
it is related because the violent assault committed makes it more likely he attacked the cops minutes later.
. the robbery does not matter. theft is not a capital offense, even in
wanted to walk down the street . and he is dead . and the pd is using his silence in
no he was walking in the street big difference
a story that continues to repeat itself, over and over and over in america.
it is sound like they may have been racially profiling him as a suspect
let is be clear , pd never said officer darren wilson was responding to robbery call before contact w/ until
this is obviously contrived. the is doing what they can to save face.
sounds like typical scramble to ' back fill facts ' after a crime.
never shoot unless you fear for your life. injuries heal.
fox propaganda machine planting doubt & amp ; suspicion in racist minds.
did not say much of anything and continue to withhold information which only fuels more confusion.
exactly ... see what a few appearances on annuity can do ?
things that make you go. . . hmm ‚Äú.
icymi : the info given today seems to line up with this witness account , even the alleged theft :
none the less he is ! good day.
should not have assaulted the cop, leaving him injured.
you miss my point entirely. he is dead.
could he be anymore incoherent ?
if you leave our we will be alone. knowwhatiwannasaynext
it does not matter the dead. the end
does not matter can not shoot him. you have to follow the use of force continuum
i still do not see the admission of theft here.
he is dead and damn sure will not be robbing anyone else.
you miss my point he should not be dead
everybody was orgasming about a white cop killing an " innocent " black kid . reality kicked them in the
i imagine it is kind of nerve racking
kid was a dumb thug but stealing cigars should not get him the death penalty
cops always get the blame. problem with that is that the cops are usually right.
this ordeal probably saved some lives.
going for an officer is gun should ...
by shooting him what happened to simply arresting him ?!
good thing the cop was tried by a jury to find out if he is guilty too right ??
try stopping a 300 lb man without shooting. the average sized officer can not either.
have you tried arresting a 350lb primate charging you with a lit cigar lately ?
lets finish this convoy once the fbi/do/local investigations have ended.
the thug should not have tried to take the cops gun.
real asset to society. such a loss.
can you imagine how this dude would have turned out if he got away with beating a policeman ?
i did not know robbery was justified by shooting him 8+ times while he was unarmed ????
everyone always wants to blame the cops. cops are usually right.
oh now watch the white people are not going to riot. how boring !
that will certainly kill the mood ...
will not matter. they did not let the facts get in the way with st. skittles ...
good thing he was tried by a jury if his peers to determine his alleged guilt !
they were upset about an unarmed person being gunned down by an over zealous officer. dick
if white ppm do riot you can bet it will not be burning their own neighborhood.
he charged a according to an eyewitness.
if they do it will be with class. nieman marcus watches out !
even if was running down the street with a bag full of boosted goods , he deserved a trial .
or is it the self defense of an officer who was defending against a criminal ?
pick up a history book and learn who guy fawkes was. tire of ignorance.
he helped the arrest some criminals and domestic terrorists ? way to go !
snag a history book that addresses this.
who has a guy fawkes mask ?
and i am far from anonymous, despite my support for some of them. try harder.
he was surrendering with his hands up, yet he was shot to the point of death
we honestly do not know at this point. facts looks bad for brown supporters
supported placing a catholic king on the throne to create a dictator
on this topic it seems you are. fawkes was a religious zealot.
i am cool.
proof that an unarmed person was shot dead ...
the topic of this thread is the extrajudicial killing of an unarmed man.
you at nothing to say better stu. retard fag
this is the kind of ignorance i was talking about.
you have seen no ignorance or hypocrisy from me, at all.
i am a libertarian who hates it when fellow libertarians use that idiot thing.
congrats on successfully derailing this topic from snitching to gunpowder plot
ill just leave this here for you, darby.
you are not a fucking libertarian. you are just another big government conservative.
that is a but i do see the aforementioned fawkes low
the snitch stupidity was used to derail from the points the guy was making.
a friendly reminder that is human garbage.
howdy has it as his banner.
ignorance and hypocrisy which is illustrated in this entire convoy.
because he is a snitch.
a religious zealot does not a dictator make. your focal point is flawed.
not but you are aware the mask is aligned with a movie, not history ?
no one in this thread is flying a fawkes.
was the opposite of libertarian & amp ; anarchist was for theocratic dictatorship
he is human garbage ‚Äú because he is saying something rational ?
well that makes a bit more sense. though my support of pp14 is irrelevant here.
anarchist libertarian no, supporter of theocratic dictatorship yes.
off original but yes. i still support paypal14, but back to original topic
. came after the ‚Äú entrapped people in nola for fbi ‚Äú part of is life.
just pointing out the ignorance and hypocrisy of using guy fawkes.
it is used as an anti-government symbol. you are aware of that right ?
my mentions are being blown up harder than guy tried to blow up parliament so, done
do not worry about it. all they are good at is name calling.
i responded to the snitch bull shit, which was not the origins of the topic.
that was directed toward the anarchist flying the stupid of mask.
and it is a face that belonged to a real person who was pro-religious dictator
he helped the take down evil people. that is a good thing.
i do not think anonymous is specifically anti government, but i am not them, either.
another ignorant anarchist using the stupid guy fawkes mask.
was not a dictator roflwat
he tried to blow up parliament to put in place a religious dictator. so yes.
and because he committed this crime, rather than be arrested, he was killed.
rt . : this is simple : if was a robbery suspect , why didn‚Äôt police say that on day
even if he that does not justify them killing him. total abuse of police power.
do not even think he was the robbery suspect
because probably right about now they can see that a riot is about to kick off
it was said day one.
it must have been too peaceful for their tastes last night
they was coming up with a good lie
they had to get their lie straight !! geez
so when do police ask robbery suspects to walk on the sidewalk and to get out the street.
subdued by rhetoric imbued with disconnected views so witnesses confused by mismanagement get bamboozled and damaged
here it is my dedication to michael brown please share to fight against police brutality
countdown : one hour until police release the name of the officer that shot .
countdown one hour until police release the name of the officer that shot. ‚Äù
it did not take this long to get the names of the police/emt workers involved in the death of
i can imagine they can b victims of brown brutality
photos of alleged robbery involving michael brown in ( via police )
that is him same hat and outfit at seen still gave no right to kill him
that guy is much fatter than michael and older
. why are the cops releasing this ? has nothing to do with later shooting.
is robbery a death penalty in mo ? and without a trial ?
photos of alleged robbery involving in (via police)
now police issue pix of ‚Äú alleged ‚Äú robbery involving michael brown in via
now they say this not very believable.
even so since when do you shoot a suspected robber if he is unarmed and cooperating ?

i agree it is not robbery its simple shoplifting an assault

one sure way to know would be if they tested for dna on the employees shirt ...
here is a petition to stop militarization of police departments
that was very " slick " of the police chief to create a narrative that was a " suspect "
exactly my point a muscle bound guy shows chest-wise /big guy has softer shoulders round in belly
i thought mike brown was ‚Äú struggling ‚Äú for the cops gun ? total lies by police chief
chief should go to & amp ; write suspense thrillers !
so you‚Äôve seen the video no one else has seen ?
if that is what makes you feel better about is murder .....
these show an altercation in a store not a robbery !
if they were both suspects in a robbery, why was not johnson arrested or taken into custody ?
he was racially profiled because he fit the description of a strong arm robber ?
he knew what he was doing. smh !
key word create ... if that were true, that could have been released sunday ... sh
he just admitted on national tv that michael brown was racially profiled
are the still pictures are at the quick trip about some cigars/candy or the liquor store ?
thanks i will check it out !
we need b careful of jumping 2 conclusions. waiting to see this videotape.
what are police hiding about " drive by " shooting of black woman recording last night is action ?
nobody believes spook was shot by a drive-by ! howard grad is alive precious girl ! pray‚ô•
they had 2 make them seem violent camp ; ‚Äú thuggish ‚Äú 2 justify their continued in !
can not open their fucking ' mouths w/o lies spilling out.
the cop literally goes to cover the other cops mouth. wtf.
no one sold believe any police account of what happens to protesters .... police lie !
you do not see this happening in the burbs.
we can make this go big, right away. could i talk to witnesses somehow ?
by the cops it looks like
so they allow police helicopters and not media huh ....
just did a google map search . there are 2 quick trips in and they are on opposite ends of
sure did. we have when convenient for the narrative.
now shameful police say brown was not even a robbery suspect when he was shot . he was just an
when are they going to release the real name of the cop that shot mike brown ?
truthfully would not expect anything less from the police ...
do you really have to listen to any authority right now ? they on some damage control spirit.
i am the best ... now you know ...
the name of the officer who fatally shot teenager will be released shortly . watch cnn :
we urge the united states to the termination action against democracy and freedom of speech in the usa !
that is pretty dangerous to his family
because you were there wow a witness !!!!
how is the whole base going get mad at me for something i aunt
why is the news reporting my statement s wrong
how does releasing his name help ?
the name of the officer who fatally shot teenager will be released shortly. watch cnn :
when all you hear is shortly ... they are scared
stupid to release the name ...
sometimes is it happens all time about the shooting
must remove the police to allow the opposition to hold protests.
let is be cleared ... was executed !!! there is a huge difference !
can not wait to talk about this in my ago class.
a little late after already released it.
strong armed robbery means unarmed ?? who is the idiot anchoring ?
and then the death threats will come ... by those who protest violence.
he was an 18 year old man. facts please !
so last week nypd tried to tell us that was not in a chokehold , now police telling us assaulted
they telling us lies on this sunday
developing : police in expected to announce the name of the officer who killed unarmed teen michael brown within the
i mean really why all the secrecy all this time ?
mike brown was staying with his grandmother for the summer , who lived in the community .
mike brown was staying with his grandmother for the summer, who lived in the community.
police chief now says that the robbery does not relate to the initial contact between darren wilson and michael brown
wonder could have seen that !
was he lying then or is he lying now ? what a cluster ...
then it is even more inappropriate to release that incident report.
q : why did he stop michael brown ? " because he was walking down the middle of the street
blocking traffic is what he said
once upon a time streets were a free-for-all.
if you stopped every teenager who walked on the road you would never get anything else done.
why not just honk the freaking horn instead of shooting him several times ?
you could get killed walking in the middle of the street ! oh wait.
q why did he shoot michael brown ?
the officer who shot did not know he was a suspect in a robbery , according to police chief .
then how come brown is name is in the incident report ?
wow ... now y'all are in the kid is head. amazing
i mean this is some real bs this is worse than train martin help us jesus
what is the purpose of police statement other than demagoguery and pure propaganda ?
criminalizing black youth cops right to murder them. that is america for you.
mike brown is family deserves justice. so do the rest of us.
there goes that extremely threadbare defense for gunning down an unarmed teenager in the street.
that will not stop from saying he knows exactly what happened with second to second detail.
perhaps if the allegations are true but i am skeptical about the chief is statement.
yet they strategically doc drop the robbery. fckn racist ass cops
maybe because he was not at all a suspect in that robbery. aye ?
did cook up jaywalking stop because he did not have probable cause ?
more : police chief identifies darren wilson as cop who shot michael brown
i have same outrage at injustice -coming from blended family-see both sides unlike you
forget to mention wilson is black
you have already declared him innocent.
y was he in the car in. the cop did not even know about shoplifting.
i have funded by me. i do not shoot people with them.
try not hard to figure out.
i admit based on history with le. better than all ur assumptions.
then why did he continue to speak ?
they try to bully their opinions to be right. it is very amusing actually.
hell yes. not only sympathy but empathy. breaks my heart to see children gunned down.
police are never allowed to use deadly force unless lives are threatened. kid was walking away.
faced with a riot like this ?
i think having holder is office involved has encouraged the honesty.
interesting to note p chief says they did not know michael was a suspect when they shot him.
looting is a reaction to rage and very few people looted.
he authorized the release of info. now you are starting to babble.
do not have outrage do not have all the facts. looting cause loss of credibility.
does not matter if him was grounds for officer to stop bc of description.
they have not been in charge since the beginning pc called for outside pd on way to scene.
sorry for loss. u have same outrage when young white men are killed ?
that photo has already been proven not to be michael brown. jesus.
so let is just call it even for michael brown then. wtfe.
time to end police militarization now !
i believe it will all come out now that ferguson pd is not in charge.
yes and they should have been more forthcoming -regardless innocent kid dead !
they are police so my guess, not reliable. good point.
amp that warrants death ? furthermore death without trial ?
read the police report they released. they say it is him.
he is wearing the same clothes as when he was shot.
bullshit. now you are just toting progressive talking points.
i somewhat agree but if you are facing a riot you want to be in riot gear.
the controls info released. you wait until you have enough facts. unlike media
maybe the cop had your mindset ?? does not make it right
so with limited info you now read minds ?
they assume i am a black man and i am a white woman which always makes me chuckle.
shocking. two 18 year old shop lifters lied ? shoot em.
the lost control because they are being released now.
oh yes there is a reliable source.
were u there maybe you should wait for entire story !
some police officers lied too.
more police chief identifies darren wilson as cop who shot michael brown
no but officer doing duty by stopping him based on describe from c store.
i thought you were not a racist ?
i am white. what the hell difference does that make ?
i thought you were not a white man ?
i am more concerned we end the militarization of the federal agencies !
has a long history of police abuse.
why did you think that ?
you are absolutely correct. that includes the police officer right ?
can suck my nuts. the dds under obama has been funding this build up.
guess he can be shot too right ? all good
and fortunately no one has shot and killed him and he will have a trial.
because kept sending him out there to take the heat. this is the politics
i understand but until the gov and president got involved they were all d-bags.
no but officer to stop him & amp ; companion lied.
am guessing investigation took longer to protect witnesses & amp ; town was being burned.
you are missing facts. county police took over investigation same night. google it
none amp did not ask but tells me a lot re sympathies in these situations.
the cops should never shoot suspects unless their life is in danger.
that is crazy. good to know though. at least a little honesty ....
think it is since the cops admit they did not know about the shoplifting ?
i am guessing is the definitive words in your tweet- you know nothing w/certainty
wait. was your come back ‚Äú my assumptions r better than ur assumptions ‚Äú
have you watched when a ‚Äú nice ‚Äú university wins championship ?
time to end police militarization now !
because he was removed from investigation.
were it your son you be so quick to ‚Äú understand ‚Äú
well according to the they did not know when they shot him.
he authorized it after the gov. and the president ‚Äú suggested it ‚Äú. jesus.
then let them answer for that too.
i am a bully now ?
you seem obsessed with skin color. but that could just be an assumption.
i thought tweet was re looting.
you should probably use this photo of him now.
it is pointless trying to have an intelligent conversation with you.
you are going to believe the people that did this ?
did u see that the cop did not know he was a suspect when he shot him ?
time to end police militarization now !
a bulk witness saw it all ...... brown was beating officer in his own car ....
no he can not but since witnesses lied should not we wait for the rest of the story ?
the chief was doing all the talking - and saying nothing but will not release name
no he shot an innocent unarmed teenager-may not b racism but cultural
nobody with shooting but as facts come out shows much more to story.
does this video change you are feeling about ferguson pd ?
no need to shoot him after when his hands were up ! time to end police militarization now !
now that is one nutty assumption - can not teach an ..... new tricks ! i am out !!!
i guess you do not care if that is him or not - anyone of them will do ???
i know another innocent unarmed young black man killed !!
often times the speaks. this da is a cowardly douche bag in my opinion.
time to end police militarization now !
except nobody cares your color looting & amp ; rioting changes mentality of observers.
he stole swisher sweets. my pastors son stole mt. dew. shoot him too ?
when u take the side of black injustice many assume u must be black-look at protesters
no but my understanding ‚Äú is not based on racism.
it is 2014. i do not buy the fear thing. it is ignorance and stupidity.
wow we agree on something. minus the name calling of course.
that is what happened. he is suspected of shoplifting he lied resisted arrest and he is dead.
i think you meant your lack of understanding.
all weekend ppl will be talking about the " robbery " instead of the shooting bc pd did not release
he did that quickly amp ; made moves. like ok lets get that wheel spinning.
it smells do not it. this is the plan to get darren wilson off. period.
if we shot everyone in the street for stealing , imagine the carnage on wall st.
they would need a helluva huge cannon ..........
yes but cops only shoot for stealing material things. not peoples life savings.
if we shot everyone in the street for stealing, imagine the carnage on wall st.
if we shot everyone in the street for stealing, imagine the carnage on wall st. ‚Äù
we are going to need to try it out, before i comment
those thefts are all well clear of the legal limit.
there would be no one left in government
ladies and do not tip your waitress as it perpetuates wage slavery.
getting sleepy ... kitty meowed out all nice !
cops were extra aggressive to incite fear and cause chaos , giving the pd time to destroy and/or manufacture any
already blocking him and reporting his dumb ass as spam. ‚Äú press ‚Äú for
you hit the motherfucking nail !
that makes a lot of sense !
pd releases robbery incident report smearing but not shooting incident report . did they think we wouldn‚Äôt notice ?
thank you we demand police report now not smear tactics !!
demand release of police statement on mike brown is death not smear tactics !
. these families need to start filing defamation suit, not just civil suit.
trying to taint possible jury ?
only ' cause commentators who can not recognize the robbery as a robbery lose all cred. still murder
witnesses came forward from the beginning saying he had stolen from a convenience store.
do you still buy the gentle giant narrative ?
if you can justify shooting an unarmed teenager by saying " he might have been committing a misdemeanor " you
attacking an officer is now a misdemeanor ....
hey it is a fucking racist ! block, you son of a bitch.
might does not even constitute evidenciary support for any criminal charges.
st. louis co police tell me ofcr shot a man who pointed handgun at him at chambers & amp ;
according to police that is the truth
why should we believe anything police have to say, will not release # of bullets or autopsy
for keeping us informed. stay safe !
how many weeks until police interview witnesses ?
because , of course , when someone commits a robbery they stroll down the middle of the street where everyone
and he allegedly not commuted robbery. two different categories.
garner killed over cigarettes and mike brown killed over swisher sweets cigars.
that‚Äôs what i said. he‚Äôs setting the table for the officers defense.
watch the video. it was him. family and friend confirmed it
they already said they found them on him.
wow a fucking lie. they took a week to come up with this lie.
they really want us to stop smoking ... or na ?
um there have been times when others have posted pics of themselves on social media after a crime
there is and his family and friend confirmed it was him. it was 8-9
no in white cop world ... you know the drill.
there would be a time and date stamp on any digital source of those pics.
did anyone find any cigars on either of the alleged jaywalkers ?
that a lot. maybe not here, but it happens.
2 senseless deaths over cigars land of the free is a joke
and then his friends gives multiple interviews with media ! does not pass the sniff test
stop giving them press releases. you know that is the next justification.
that seems like the pattern.
at least us were not that bright ...
police officers are saving us from lung cancer by shooting us in the head
the time line does not even seem right.
breaking news : name of officer who shot - officer daren wilson -
chief seemed a bit nervous to release that name ...
breaking news name of officer who shot - officer daren wilson -
how many goddamn short buses have u ridden ? darren ... darren .... darren. durrrrin

thats not the name you first posted !! dont you want to admit you had the person ??
breaking news name of officer who shot - officer daren wilson - ‚Äù
are we supposed to be cool & amp ; remain calm when the police after murdering a teenager slander him
stand against domestic violence amp ; sign or stand 4 do
we did not lose are cool the last bazillion times it happened.
stand against domestic violence amp ; sign or stand 4 do
stand against domestic violence amp ; sign or stand 4 do
stand against domestic violence amp ; sign or stand 4 do
get emotional and stay emotional. our lives are at stake
are you saying that anyone outraged has permission to loot complete strangers ?
scary black man scary black man !!!!!
i sure as hell not.
stand against domestic violence amp ; sign or stand 4 do
so saying that the suspect was involved in a robbery before he got shot is slander ?
wait was not michael brown stopped because of a routine patrol ? police can not even keep their stories straight
you are witnessing the genesis of a crafted cover story designed to protect yet another murdering copy.
sounds like the fix is on !
boom rt why was pd still looking for the suspect 7 hours after michael brown had been killed ?
i am reading the other pages, too
maybe you ought to educate yourself on police procedures before insinuating things you know nothing about
this says it all
the earlier time if that is what it was. so tweet was legit.
good i will un-retweet that until someone confirms it.
not entirely sure because of the redacted sections though.
they did not know they already got the thief.
boom rt why was pd still looking for the suspect 7 hours after michael brown had been killed ?
looks like pd spent their whole week on a smear campaign against instead of investigating or being at all helpful
yeah especially how they got a dead guy to pose for pictures ‚Äú pretending ‚Äú to rob someone ????
not even the police department is saying that those photos are of him. come now ‚Ä¶
of course they are not saying it.
" : " you can not jump over a murder & amp ; talk to me about some cigars ‚Ä¶
sorry but he has gone to chicago several times to churches/ leaders to stop the killings
murder it is ok to skip over the facts and due process.
nor can you call an assault on citizens ‚Äú protection ‚Äú but its all a matter of perspective
according to the convenient store video, michael brown was no saint.
actions have consequences. next get a job.
how was eliminated. x told everyone about it. no satan for power
white on white mass killings especially of small children. instead more guns sold
next should talk on tv about those other things he does besides bitching about.
when ever something like this tragedy happens all al sharp ton sees is $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$. he makes off dividing
and by bullshit agenda ‚Äú i mean pad your bank account.
also other black organizations fighting to stop black on black. what at your white on white
killed over cigars ... were they cubans ?
breaking : police chief names darren wilson in killing of unarmed teen
you must be out yo fucking mind.
breaking police chief names darren wilson in killing of unarmed teen ‚Äù -- fuck outta here
why does not media mention the guy attacked the officer & amp ; reached for his gun ???
every incident report i have seen says " the suspect was x , " " the suspect did y .
i just heard there is no incident report
i bet you he was 292 lbs. not 250-290. two hundred and ninety-two !
dammit that is right. there are no names in the narrative of a police report.
clearly it was re written after the fact for today is press conference.
this is the full what you showed was page 6 which is where supplementary info began
it is because it is completely fabricated.
cause he was they filled in the blanks as everything unfolded
someone called it in at 11:51 and the footage shows him leaving around 11:54 ?
cooked. simple. cold blooded murdering continues
that is exactly what i said.
coming from someone from bayberry ‚Äú (low) , andy did not even carry a gun.
they are straight up lying. it is remarkable.
the police officer who made the report identified him as mike brown after he arrived at the shooting.
but they do not release suspect names right ? according to the police chief two days ago
i guess but done already admitted to being their and the cigarillo incident even before the video.
they even fucked up and put two different dates 8/9 and 8/13z sloppy cover up
again. this was nearly a week ago.
i was wondering the same thing. they run that place like its bayberry
how is the shooter not the ? see : how to rationalize your ok would up racist ideology.
because it was after the fact.
the other day i asked a manager at the market if police had requested surveillance video . she said no
thanks. now we need a pic of what michael brown was wearing to refute the video.
. i have been in market and it looks exactly like where the alleged robber was standing.
a person who makes his living asking questions, that is who.
who are you to expect any type of answer in the first place ?
it was not the quick stop that got burned down ?
police are embarking on what can only be described as an elaborate smear campaign of michael brown
sign and share time to end police militarization now !
everybody wanted transparency. now they are getting it and complaining because brown was not an angel. oops
smear must be latin for cover-up.
... on the street without due process. what is wrong with you ?

police name the officer who shot teenager . watch :
i understand but they are quick to give out someone arrests history
you can call it what you like still sounds like fabrication thank you
police name the officer who shot teenager. watch :
and you know that is the truth !!
police name the officer who shot teenager. watch :
fuck your packages. we want justice !
it does matter to some people.
does it even matter though ?...
is first to report this. did you find that plane yet ?
the fact of the matter is that it took way too long for them to release anything period
wow robbery so that is how they justify it.
especially if they r male bulk no matter was age.
you know this officer and his family are in great. danger now, no question about it !!
if it is should be clear eventually) , that along with other circumstances could justify it ...
or would have been quick to release details if it was a black on black crime.
it is called an investigation ...
another police shooting in protest-plagued : ( scott olson , getty images )
while they are plagued with protest - parts of africa is plagued with ebola.
who is the idiot that thinks this is the solution to anything ?
yes .... accidents do happen when you put the police under the spot.
that witness is in danger ...
has to be some white guy lacking evolution to comment !
should be under federal custody at this point.
that will happen when you point a gun at a cop and refuse to stand down

an observation from yrs in practice - if it takes you 5 days to get your story out & amp
might be the definition of inept
reminder : was a kid who just wanted to walk down a street . and for that , he is
sure thing. i am young, i have got plenty to learn.
this. we are made up of emotion. objective is often a code for male/real/white.
. he is a suspect in a crime and allegedly assaulted a police officer.
not if he does not know it is bad info at the time.
they are. the photos of him match the police report
original point was lost somewhat, no worries. people are emotional, never disputed that.
when observing the then you have to have more of a clear head.
how many names could we say ?
depends on the obligation one would expect you to do due diligence before passing on lies, no ?
not sure why you think anybody gives a fuck what you ‚Äú want ‚Äú.
go fuck yo.
not that i ever stated what my feelings on the situation was. death is awful.
nor you. personal attacks are not the best way to conduct yourself, yo.
i think you really need to study ‚Äú objectivity ‚Äú and question that concept.
it is called delegation. person in charge expects underlings to do grunt work of due diligence.
more about me than you, given the attention i am getting. peace out.
in it is funny how quick people jump to insults though
he committed a robbery then punched a cop in the face, those are facts
can you say rayon martin ? ‚Äú
also it is not an opinion.
his profile states dolt. we have our answer.
deciding without emotions on occasion ! = devoid of emotions (sociopath) .
definitely a huge problem. the biggest problem here though is a lack of transparencies all round.
the ferguson chief says that his feelings are hurt that ppl consider him a part of the problem .
even though it seems difficult. this country does not need racial division. we are americans.
wow ... making it about his feel feels after a teen has been murdered ?!
exactly. so do not lose the purpose of the tweet by rahrahing for white people over a genrlztn
sad. i will stand for your rights.
we should never as people respond to a crime with crime. we should do what is right.
advocating against meaningless and harmless white prejudice.
that time mike brown has no feelings to speak of.
the chief says that his feelings are hurt that ppm consider him a part of the problem.
stand for the constitution and the american dream. that is what is being violated.
we should be so thankful for it. the comment was a generalization but that generalization
it is too that is for sure.
never said he was not. i was replying to your racist comment above.
the whole situation is awful. the officer should be held accountable for his action.
officially my favorite use of this !
if i lived there i can not promise that i would react differently.
your anger is understandable. but your generalized judgment is a shame.
i do not know you personally. i judge people as individuals.
so many people are interested in raking the protesters over the coals instead of looking ...
you should recognize a friend when you see one. i believe the solution is thinking of everyone.
i do. and more.
always a blessing when people stand together for what is right.
he could not have been serious ... they are so oblivious its damn near hilarious !
at what caused their reaction.
boo fucking join the club. advocate that same thing for pop and stop thinking of yourself
it is many. i do not buy into reverse racism. it is a farce.
art called it ...
white people love the victim card.
no need to be condescending. so by your comment its us against them ?
absolutely the looting is unfortunate but i am not going to judge those people.
i did not advocate for white people. so you are saying every white person is racist.
i agree. i hope the ferguson pd comes to the same conclusion
most people would objectively come to the same conclusion.
yes. because you feel that having white people on our side should be such a blessing.
based on my personal 39 years of observations, history and current events ...
what is he smoking he cannot be that stupid.
that is the pot calling the kettle black !
they have been making this whole situation all about them by focusing on the looting.
bummer that since when did the cops start having feelings that could be hurt ?
me blowing smoke up your behind would not do anyone any good.
oh , a suspect in a robbery ? that changes everything . everyone knows summary execution is the penalty for
do not start with an excuse ..... the excuse follows.
everybody knows all the eyewitness say the same story
i have not seen the video. is it that obvious ?
agree. but ... does help to have a full understanding of situation.
he obviously was asking for it. smh
especially when you are dressed nothing like the suspect in the stills. yep. .
it is not him did he lose 40 to 50 lbs from robbery to shooting ?
totally no excuse for deadly force ; but it explains why officer confronted in first place.
u do not know that all the facts are not evened out yet
a robber who had a weapon, the cop had been worried about. violence
do not forget he stole some cigars.
no other people you really do not know much about anything that happen
it is almost like they watched the zimmerman trial ...
unarmed robbery in which a person stole some cigars, true menace to society
how about fighting a police officer and reaching for his gun
we do not call ambulances for the summarily executed.
yeah his friends if my friend was shot in not going to make him look bad
they released that information this morning about the robbery knowing was not stopped for it ? explain why . explain
you know why. the next step will be showing that brown overreacted.
how can the governor allow this trifling bs from pd ? it is like keystone cops with bullets
that is to keep peace ! the know shit is about to go down like wiki !
and where are your facts ? this is all coming from your vivid imagination ..... right ?
listen to the eye witness account that posted.
character assassination after his assassination.
just did a great story on that. comparing headlines of white shooters to black victims.
they probably figured hey worked for zimmerman ‚Äú ...
character assassination. jury pool bias.
i knew why from the first comments section. every racist was saying, ‚Äú see ? ‚Äù
none of this justifies of anyone with their hands in the air !
tainting the jury pool more precisely, perhaps.
we know why. trying to excuse their behavior.
show me the fact i smelled a lie and cover-up from the beginning
to be clear : an unarmed teenager possibly stealing a box of cigars does not warrant being shot to death
fucked up police. police ‚Äú.
hey on top of ban self admitted idiot yer also restarted low + their thugs
speak to them tell em !!!
you would be blown away by the swedish police then ‚Ä¶
not even if he is stealing.
police are humans too and when confronted with that situation no training is perfect to predict a response
thanks for clearing that up. i was really confused about that.
. a aggressive young man might get shot if he attacks a cop.
just in : police chief thomas jackson tells they will release the name of the police officer today
whats your point more bad eggs in power ?
nothing someone said draw flies w/ honey, i do not see people as flies.
never most were the ‚Äú shots ‚Äú were fired b/cops.
of those bad eggs should never been in those jobs. thuggies/thugs.
pd beat , & amp ; charged innocent man with " property damage " for bleeding on officer is clothes
their racism slivers down to their families
police executed a teenager for suspicion of robbery. let is focus.
what the fuck is going on !?
educated guess : possible reason they did not release shooter is incident report -- he did not write one on
we are with police chief thomas jackson ‚Ä¶
you are so .
of course never a good idea putting lies in writing.
what was the robbery report date ? same date as the robbery ; and shooting ?
supposed to be in the case wonder there is nothing in wilson is file that shows previous problems.
makes more sense than anything else that we have heard !
clear signs the cop knew this was a bad shooting.
do you know whether reports written on the fly or later at the station ?
are you doing a special report tonight at ten ?
i would advise him not to write anything
i want to be as smart as one day.
is a great ‚Äú guesser ‚Äú.
your being very generous this reeks of cover up
reasonable explanation but sounds like ‚Äú special privilege ‚Äú. who is he ‚Äú kin ‚Äú to ?
surely worked that way. one wonders what might have been in wilson is file otherwise.
would have been all lies anyway
that is about testifying against yourself, not carrying out your duties as a police officer.
police report on the shooting was assigned a number, referred to in robbery report.
its called the fifth amendment to the us constitution. you may have heard of it.
so the wolf guards the hen house, huh ?
if dorian johnson is a suspect in a robbery that justified killing , why has not dorian been arrested ?
oh believe me they getting warrant drafted now.
he gave like 5 media interviews before he was even questioned. he was not hiding.
i asked the very same thing on facebook minutes ago.
and wait for day 4 to speak to him
amen. why is not he in jail ? because the police report is a load of crap
exactly what i was thinking ... he gave interviews to media 3-4 days before even talking to police
was not on film roughing up the clerk.
all of this over some stupid cigars
because they are making this up as they go !
question of the day. they will tell you there were busy with the riot.
when he was they would have arrested him.
i just said that.
how many white celebrities have been caught shoplifting and end up dead in streets ? i will wait .
can u say loan ?? go ahead tell her name 3x. lol
do not hold your breath waiting
how many white celebrities have been caught shoplifting and end up dead in streets ? i will wait.
as soon as you physically fight cops and run they can shoot under fleeing felon law
only in films. and we are their live entertainment.
raises hand pooh i know, i know !.... um, none.
i shoplift all the time and i am still alive.
and i feel silly for pointing this out but ... in america we do not have executions by gunfire for
corner stores on my community sell single cigarettes all the time. the cops do not bother them.
you wrote do not ‚Äú when you meant ‚Äú must not ‚Äú
unless they stole skittles and iced tea ... or even if they bought them legally ...
and legal hassles like that are why certain folks are set on getting rick perry into the white house
we also do not hold trials in the court of public opinion ...
wait for all the facts please
this pd chief press conference is amazing ... he just admitted darren wilson stopped him bc of the jaywalking .
thats a major point if you think about it
there are worse crimes than jaywalking. i get warnings for jaywalking. but gets shot. wth
200 cops in riot gear in because there is a prayer circle and a concerned compassionate community
i am sure i would have felt that.
200 cops in riot gear in because there is a prayer circle and a concerned compassionate community
mob 200 cops in riot gear in because there is a prayer circle and a concerned compassionate community
i was being sarcastic. that is what the cops think of the community.
so is hat disappeared and he changed into shoes right ?
so is hat disappeared and he changed into shoes right ? ‚Äù and shorts.
so is hat disappeared and he changed into shoes right ? pants.
and where did the cigars go ?
the guy on the street is wearing pants. the guy in the did is wearing shorts.
e they only in america [music video] :
idea. sure that will come out soon !
does not even look like him ...
so is hat disappeared and he changed into shoes right ? ‚Äù serious question tho
other pictures do show his hat laying on the ground, but you are right about the shoes
rt so is hat disappeared and he changed into shoes right ?
so is hat disappeared and he changed into shoes right ?
lost weight too rt so is hat disappeared and he changed into shoes right ?
sadly that is him. if he really did rob the store
his hat was at the scene
that is true and sad at the same time
the name of the officer who shot has been named . his name is darren wilson , a 6-year veteran
his life is forever changed !
are you able to or could you break down the ‚Äú packet ‚Äú of information ??
nope anonymous said his name was bryan wilma
why the discussion of a robbery ? please review the tape and update us.
what robbery never heard anything at a robbery ??
is going to be charged with murder ?
shocking ..... got anything right ? nnnope
i want to see a picture of the police officer (darren wilson)
was this the same name released by anonymous yesterday ?
is that why they brought in st police ?
agreed. anon released a lot of incorrect inflammatory content. pretty shameful.
if anyone is looking for a reason to murder me execution-style in the street , i stole a coke from
how many people did you have to assault batter and intimidate to get that coke ?
it would not matter if he would assault or battered every single person in the walmart ...
are you tempted to replace it now ?
i stole pantyhose from when i was 16.
breaking : lawyer says that brown is friend confirms that he did take the cigarillos ( via . msnbc )
stealing a box of cigarillos should lead to a courtroom, not a casket.
still does not justify cold blooded murder
so he deserved to die for that ?
who is this friend. ? what friend grasses his mate ? really
i do not believe anything the police say.
no weapon so why does it matter if it was actually him or not ?
because that is not what is being discussed. you are obviously trying to change the conversation.
still do not justify his murder.
it would have if he had not fought with the cop.
sooooooo chief of lied and said that an ambulance was on the scene ?
they left him in the streets for 10mins or so with him just lying there.
an ambulance can be seen in the video on scene. failed to provide treatment. bad !
note. not even in death
that is the million dollar question
that alone should be investigated.
i heard that lie come out of his mouth too.
yea not from all the aids i have seen. no ambulance just sum1 is truck !
they put him in a minivan ?
they put him in a black suv
could have mike brown been alive and unconscious and assumed he died why was cpr not started ?
this has to be the worst cover up ever.
this is seriously messing with my emotions ... we are people too !!!! no respect even in death ...
looks like this case will go all with lies, cover up and smear campaign !!!
was abused and denied care by medical staff the same as. fire them now !
where is the autopsy report ?!
i have seen video of an emt check for pulses, shake his head and walk away.
but we are supposed to trust their photos ?
is our country coming to ? seriously !
this was more than likely the corner is suv. ambulances do not typically remove doa from scene.
yes that was a lie. it had been said before they took his body away in a suv
yeah but they walked away and did not do anything else
he lied and flung accusations throughout. incompetent.
chief of lied and said that an ambulance was on the scene ?
this is being handled very badly ! wtf let is a murderer go on vac ?
mt chief of said that an ambulance was on scene ?
swat team in have state mandated amurder insurance ' to protect them from lawsuits if they kill anyone .
surely they are going to bankrupt the insurance company. they love killing !
same as that asshole who can kill someone and still enjoy life. rich above the rules
dear max why did u block she is quite baffled ! what is happened she wonders ?
of course they will go bankrupt, only to be bailed out. rinse. repeat.
swat murder insurance does not that make every1 wonder how often they'v been knowingly murdering ppm ?
swat team in have state mandated murder insurance ' to protect them from lawsuits if they kill anyone.
well one person already is collecting, a second almost collected, and it is only wednesday ...
expect you can)
i would call that premeditation ‚Äú ...
maybe hard hitting should be covering what is going on in , mo . instead of fat shaming the first
the is the to many are being.
thought i admire generosity, mr. shuck row.
i‚Äôm getting a huge kick out of how the teabags have flocked to the ‚Äú pro-police ‚Äù angle.
. as if you have any idea what is being reported on fox news.
his name is try reading.
that sounds too much like common sense.
and calling robin a coward.
do not be just do not be a troll with a red herring argument.
fair enough. my dig at her was as no better than hers at fox. pot/kettle.
all they will cover is the looting
hes a black they do not care about people of color
i would rather do not cover, .
except fox does not do news and is not fat ... otherwise life is still complicated and tragic
maybe should just remove the word ' news ' before they are pulled up on trades descriptions.
everyone who fans this wants a follow from you.
please do not use news. in the same sentence. as fox. it is fox spews.
that was super nice amp ; unnecessary. thank you. faith in twitter humanity restored momentarily low
and you are right. insulting you was uncalled for. i apologize.
and that means they would actually have to talk to people who live there.
that might actually be not punditry.
she does plenty of good things. i am giving her the benefit of not attacking without context.
i do not think they would know news if it hit them in the face
it is like the real news outlets only cover what social cares about smfh
oh i think the world can do without is opinion of .......
call it like you see it. awesome !
they do not aim to cover news, but to create it.
because she is so fat ?
this is we are talking about ! insulting liberals is their first priority.
unfortunately would have to do actual journalism !
watch : surveillance video of strong-arm robbery linked to michael brown
this us not middle eastern countries where the consequence of theft us death. .
you mean those useless idiots who freaked out over janet jackson is nipple ?
they have already murdered this young man, now you will assassinate his character too ?
i did not know the trial and verdict was complete.
that is a good response. take care.
yes homework versus robbing store is prob better way to start one is day.
but i thought brown was a saint.
and if it did happen like that, he will be punished. the cop lost his mind.
more than one witness has described the same story in the same way
will we ever really know the truth.
facts and fox news ‚Äú is an oxymoron.
petty theft is justification for public execution in america ? ok, got it thanks !
and thank you agreed we do not know the facts yet.
who had his hands up surrendering
so i am not the only one seeing things '.
. to and her racist flux news colleagues, all black kids look alike.
but shooting amp killing an unarmed suspect who is surrendering is news issue not to mention
thank you for proving my precise point. let is let the evidence speak.
pigs will do anything to protect their own.
i do not know what tune she is singing, other than seeking facts.
does pay you to post photos & amp ; series ? leaf it will :
freak out while he shot him in the back ? sounds like
issues have been around since vietnam - do you know story ? still happening
the full truth must be seen
who gets gunned down when surrendering
guy was unarmed guy is dead - policeman pulled trigger
video does not show the instance that all the stills are from
do we even have a fcc ?
irrelevant cause it was not him, stop sensationalizing the news.
you are not far we can smell the bullshit
oh so this is how america justifies his killing üëç good job guys
his hands were up international symbol - even used in wild west
is that a reason to execute him ? and saint skittles ? wow mock the dead much ?
petty theft is a reason to shoot an unarmed person in america ? ok got it !
i disagree. we have convicted them for deploying tanks and blocking 1st amendment rights to peaceably assemble.
if had been a white tea party rancher, even armed would be singing a different tune.
even if the incident occurred. $30 in swisher sweets does not merit murder by cop.
i hope that is a joke, facts from fox ? hilarious !
you take care too. t'was fun !
you all covered the mass shooter differently ~ you are painting as a
but then again cops in same town beat a man and arrested him for bleeding on them
wrong. the truth has not come out. ballistics reports. autopsies, etc.
tape is from not august.
racist as also tape is from june not august.
good point but what does that have to do with unarmed execution ? robbery is not punishable by execution
policeman killed an unarmed suspect who was surrendering
just when the media was about to canonize him like saint skittles
no it certainly does not. unfortunately pushing and shoving a man is what started this.
surrendering i find that extremely hard to believe
yup. the officer was just profiling them for walking while black.
let is remember the fact that the cops were looking for the robbery suspect 7hours after brown was shot
after chief said cop did not know he was suspect ... i recant.
untimely deaths of us veterans surely is ... get back to that please !
that is not execution. it is a cop who is a prob was freaked out.
want to know was a week ago ! there is a cover up going on in
my yes cool heads can wait for truth
why was the suspect in the video wearing different clothes & amp ; shoes than michael brown ?
as per report mike did not fit the description but hey just look at the pics
beating he shoved him once and walked out walking down the street is not a crime.
again ... so petty theft justifies execution style murder in america ? . please clarify the relevance ...
i believe the constitution innocent until proven guilty
with the officer approaching brown about j walking not stolen swisher sweets
you release the robbery report and not the shooting report ? do you think we do not see you ?
wait till you see cable news runs with this shit.
here is the police report . somehow cops valued a box of swishers at nearly $50 . time to stop
could have been a 60 count box which are ~ $40. box like this :
oh for sure. anon has been exceptionally awful though !
you have a link or you just taking their word for it ?
i stole gum from a drugstore as a kid. glad in alive to tell it.
they have the whole thing on video.
the property would have been valued by store employee not cops. retail cost as determined by business.
i guess if you do not read any of my other tweets ever.
notice the top this says 2nd suspect. mike brown is suspect. please read everything out there.
man. in so heated over this
it was on the news where i live.
have you seen the video ?
it also says they did not arrive on the scene for the first time until 8/13
you should be focusing on the robbery charge and not the shoplifting charge.
they are not finished did not want to sign rough draft.
for real. i buy a box for 15 bucks.
robbery involves threat or the use of force or violence to take the property
so not even a felony ... hahn
i bet they just typed that up this morning.
actually it is pretty reasonable. maybe do research before tweeting to the masses ?
right. i made better report cards on photo shop üò≠
if he stole a case of cigars, where were they ?
good look thank you !
anon has been pretty awful through this whole thing.
why robbery. whats the difference between shoplift or robbery. i have not read report yet
so there are already two different charges ! none of them shows michael browns name !!!
teenager will not start college on monday because he was shot ten times by a police officer .
i will do that. thanks again for help.
everybody knows that ' walking while black ' is a very serious crime to racist police. obvs.
teenager will not start college on monday because he was shot ten times by a police officer.
same age as my then.
should have been thanked you for the link.
we have our own things that is bad. but not as much as you have.
amp the home office is relaxed about routinely arming our police ? i definitely think not
10 bloody shots to down someone ? bionic man ? or just police overkill ?
it is an awful event. check the hash tag for lots of anger and sadness.
is this for real ?
eyewitness report in the story says brown fled from being put in police car. & gt ;
what is this about can you give me a link where i can read about it please ?
oh my god. for shoplifting ? this is awful ! i have to read. thank you !
will not start college monday because he was shot ten times by a police officer. ‚Äù
mike brown is family wish is to not post pictures of his dead body, the
st post dispatch story :. apparently he shoplifted a candy bar.
police chief confirms when officer stopped , he was not aware he was a suspect in a robbery .
it appears that daily the news attains more and more. this is crazy !
shot him 10 times for jay-walking or impeding traffic ......? he was standing with his hands up
. believing the officer knew his crimes, decided to fight for his freedom.
he was not aware because he was not a suspect. that is not why he was stopped.
police chief confirms when officer stopped, he was not aware he was a suspect in a robbery.
he was being apprehended. that is why the struggle ensued.
none of that is he shot, an unarmed kid 10 times .....
new link : police release video they say shows a robbery involving :
he struggled with a cop and went for his gun - that is what got his a$$ killed
the picture is not clear that could be anybody
did he deserve to die though ?
to make him he looks like a thug ? üò¥
he had no reason to shoot an unarmed person u sound ignorant üò¥ enjoy ya dday
you all can go to hell. no one deserves to get shot for anything including
where is the robbery all i see is a confrontation.
who knows this would not have happened if he did not rob a store tho
there is no proof he did not. show me your proof of hands up being shot.
i am sure he was not just like rayon martin was not
no offense taken sir and normally i would agree with you but there is more to this story.
so they killed him for stealing chips and juice gtfohüòí point is he was unarmed üòíüò¥üòí
by your logic armed robbers and mass shooters would be running free here.
witnesses have about 10 different stories is
what about the fbi ‚Äù üëÄ
oh please cut the bullshitüòíüòí them dirty ass cops will say anything
took a bullet for some wishers -. - we will never know the whole story though
would not hurt a fly i am sure low
there is no proof that he struggled with the cop
that is what i am saying !
yeah they faked the video low racist denial ‚Äù oh please
he felt threatened so he took action, not saying he is in the right but that what happen
unless he was suicidal or something than that is different.
here we have a male using a police description of what happened over 3 eyewitness accounts
do you have no empathy ? stealing = jail, not being followed then killed
why show it now because it is relevant you buffoon
keep stretching for this. we will see the truth comes out.
you guys are late with that video. it is been circulating for damn near 3 hours now.
does not matter. cop still murdered him. we will not be distracted.
that is a defense excuse when they can not defend their opinion logically.
so that means he should be shot ? you are not going to win this argument lao
killing other people because they kill people ? lol sorry did not know it was
he robbed wishers supposedly ‚Äù sh
should not have stolen or resisted arrest brought it on himself
yeah they faked the video low racist denial
where did you see videos of brown going for the officers gun ? fox news ?
wheres the money if he robbed the place looks like a soda in that persons handüò¥üò¥üò¥üò¥
i heard that he tried to grab the officers gun ? is this true ?
ya an eyewitness are the most reliable. videos do not lie - pictures do not lie.
god bless you and your ignorance. stay in your lane.
again he could have paid for them
right question who initiated it and since he robbed a store he is already the guilty party
they would not release video if it was not. hat, shoes and clothes are distinctive.
oh please even if he jacked the cop up they have other weapons besides a gun
this is just the beginning of the information !!!
currently the website has zero , repeat , zero coverage of the protests , probably due to lack of cowboy
they have already f would themselves. all the accounts of what happened. will come to light.
there is plenty in the world to cover instead of focusing on one woman is ass.
get some do not tread on me ‚Äú flags and fox will go
if it is not it is now michelle obama got to lose weight in her butt.
my column an execution in ferguson :
or no missing pretty white girl.
good to know but exactly what is to be expected.
they are obsessed with obama ' s derriere.
i remember the same type of coverage when we invaded iraq. boots on the ground ? cont ...
boots on the ground who cares ! we need more coverage of brittney spears ' blobs !
you have the right to remain silent but is not that how we ended up here ?
. it is the lack of property damage. on fox, it is property sgt ; people
is not this the truth !
or be white. or old and white. or an old, rich and white senator.
their cameras can not focus on brown people.
its not just fox news tho, fox news is just one of the many.
would need to be shot in for to cover it
your tweet really makes this page stronger :
it is too many black people for to care
too busy bitching about lotus for sure
buying time to protect a racist. murdering cop.
there was a black conservative taking about it and it was just a really different pop
unarmed teenage black boy was shot ten times by a police officer for accusation of shoplifting

police chief just confirmed that officer is interaction with michael brown not related to the robbery .
but the idea of him becoming phys. aggressive @ 1 w/ weapons strains credulity.
as if my earlier ‚Äú implication ‚Äú is to be disregarded as nonsense ...
avoiding the death penalty and less scary ‚Äú brown people ‚Äú he might feel terrified by in canada.
no maybe brown thought he was being stopped because of the robbery and became aggressive
we all did not know that one. these cops are the absolute worst.
police chief just confirmed that officer is interaction with michael brown not related to the robbery.
yep. if avoiding the death penalty my bet would be canada.
but maybe brown did not know that ?
an implication for you what was the officer doing interfering with people w/out criminal suspicion ...
this chief is out of control
what is the implication you are attempting to make ? that attacked him thinking he did ?
police chief just confirmed that officer is interaction with michael brown not related to the robbery.
use it. help light a fire under your congressman and senators to require cameras on all police
so police report and photos were meant to do what, exactly ? blame the victim ?
the police chief just said the were walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic
the robbery stuff was what -- a coordinated smear campaign ?
they now have to catch him since the left town days ago w/ his family.
outside of the precinct. exceptions for undercover and family notifications only.
police in once charged a man w/ destruction of property for bleeding on their uniforms after they beat him
they have no humanity or at the very least, any shame.

police in st. county say an officer shot and critically wounded a suspect early this morning near
. why are you referring to the protesters as suspects ??
amp was she kneeling down with her hands in the air too ?
i have yet to see that confirmed by sweeps. get your info from them, not because ...
this has got to stop.
has had zero homicides in the last year . ' black on black crime is our real problem ' folks
they acting like animals tho.
and the crime rate has gone down. -- sgt ;
yet the fallacy is so fixed that even african americans have come to believe it.
i guess they do not include the murder of a black teen by cops a homicide. convenient.
one child one wish millions moved help make it happen
and comparing the killing of ppm by police with killings by civilians is telling.
you would not happen to have a stat on that, would you ?

police say shooting death of michael brown came after teen was suspect in robbery :
he was guilty of being black ... only reason he was shot by the police ....
police chief should be removed from office.
new law 2 save time : shoot to kill all suspects of an alleged crime '
ridiculous . police trying to cover up for a botched shooting.
did not wait for the facts to come out .... this was his first response ...
bottom line : cops are supposed to use deadly force only when lives are at risk . you do not
if they were robbery how come the other kid was not under arrest ... makes no sense
... if i am reading the statute correctly, that seems like bad law, but the law.
is it really arrest when they kill the guy ?
i agree. seems perverse.
seems very little about this whole situation is not perverse.
i have no problem with cops shooting robbers, whatever race etc ...

if there is surveillance of a robbery why release stills and not the video itself ?
does not justify him getting shot several times.
maybe they will do like 911 and cut out frames
if there is surveillance of a robbery why release stills and not the video itself ?
it is easier to manipulate pictures than a video.
they did release the video. up to the journalists to post them
is that even him in the stills ?
that is what you got from those looks like some1 pushing an old lady around .... no ?
why is that even relevant ?!
got me all wrong the robbery suspect is wearing sandals but michael is wearing tennis shoes- few mind later
police : officer involved in fatal shooting of michael brown did not know he was suspect in alleged robbery .

i believe the robbery actually did happen and is not alleged.
so he thought he will pick on this black kid because it was a slow day ?
this point is irrelevant. what is important is what happened after the officer contacted the suspect.
and brown was not aware that the cop was unaware of the violent robbery brown had just committed.
still do not know his hands were up.
you thought of that all by yourself ??? amazingly irrelevant !!!
go back to sleep !!!
nothing is random where the west is concerned ...
the surveillance tape the police have on tv doesnt even look like anything near canfield green apts .
that ain‚Äôt no damn qt at all
it is not even a quiktrip either !
chief said the officer was unaware of any robbery & amp ; stopped for jay walking .
at some point they are going to stick to one story, right ?
chief said the officer was unaware of any robbery & amp ; stopped for jay walking.
baby single labels prod by click here
chief said the officer was unaware of any robbery & amp ; stopped for jay walking.
yes ma'am said story 9 shots tho i hope he dies
rt chief said the officer was unaware of any robbery & amp ; stopped for jay walking.
jay walking is punishable by death without a trial ???????
rt chief said the officer was unaware of any robbery & amp ; stopped for jay walking.
they beat the crap topic for jay walking .... sh
chief said the officer stopped for jay walking.
but assures us there is no longer any race problems in america.
chief seems to make it very clear that shooter did not write an incident report . 5th amendment .
yes sometimes they do. and sometimes they do not.
did the officer receive a garrett warning, with grant of immunity, for telling internally what happened ?
or he did but freeze it seems he lost it ! bogus bull !
its real
the fact that the chief made anything clear or very clear is unbelievable all in itself.
good eye that other incident number should have its own report and narrative.
chief seems to make it very clear that shooter did not write an incident report. 5th amendment.
how could a traitor be allowed to be chief ?
he feels bad for the family who is son he killed, right ? * sarcasm *
i heard you ask that question. good press for an answer.
just keeps getting worse by the minute.
did cook up jaywalking stop because he did not have probable cause ?
did he state the fifth amendment for not writing an incident report ?
what how is that acceptable for an officer not to file his report.
i do not get it ?
and the officer did not know about the robbery
my used to if you tell one lie, you got to tell another.
a report seems to be referenced, though, in the earlier release.
that is chief not pd. and it was in son is home, not his.
but he would have written his own incident report re jaywalking & amp ; subsequent contact.
at he is inept ; at worst, incompetent. neither qualifies him to be chief !
what is the significance in that ?
not abnormal. officer involved would not write the actual incident report in his own shooting.
police once charged a man with property damage because his blood got on their uniforms when they beat him .
the kicker was they actually lied about the blood
kinda like the whale suing jonah for food poisoning after he ate him. * shakes head *
this is not the first time pd lied . read this article .
this is not the first time pd lied. read this article.
daily beast : this is not the first time pd lied. ‚Äù
how accurate is this article ? can not find any other sources outside of daily beast.
this is not news. i saw this & amp ; posted it to fm monday.
do not want to get shot do not fight the cops and reach for their gun
i read it and it is terrible the things cops get away with
what does this have to do with you fucking up some other story ?
trust a pig and their body cam and here is proof ! please re tweet
look stupid he was a thug and his friend is to. he is lying.
why was pd still looking for the suspect 7 hours after michael brown had been killed ?
dudes running around shaming people for jumping to conclusions while doing the same thing. it is funny
of the thing to remember throughout all of this :
i am aware of the definition of anecdotal. both the tweets and officer reports are anecdotal.
. precisely. that is why police continued to investigate. brown is resistance actions certainly suggested guilt.
because no one matched the description. but in all seriousness, why ? good share.
i was not i am no armchair quarterback. i prefer to see facts ...
he chaired a fed board about not jumping to conclusions, mary. please afford him some respect.
rt why was pd still looking for the suspect 7 hours after michael brown had been killed ?
facts from a department who is known for being racist pieces of shit. umm ok.
that is the dumbest question ever asked
. anecdotal evidence inherently weighed by a court as less reliable.
i did not know there was a such thing as reverse racism. is there a default button ?
mt why was pd still looking for the suspect 7 hours after michael brown killed ?
you know that is one of the reasons they do prospective jurors right ?
unlike there are no ' warning shots ' fired.
can not believe there is a mob running your twitter account
so he assaulted the cops in the process of running away from them ?
way to go racist. sgt mcneil is african american ...
that is a huge question. .
of what what crime did he perpetrate ?
why was pd still looking for the suspect 7 hours after michael brown had been killed ?
also why did the pd write a report that brown was the robber and close the case ?
because they were bored small town, small crimes, big boredom
unlike piece of shit savage crackers are hunting down people of color for sport.
maybe they are upset that the police in their town have repeatedly used excessive force.
well this is a phenomenal point. why would they lie ?
you still have not answered my question. i need u to because you have the answers :
. that is your right. urge you to examine statutes/cases for real understanding of anecdotal evidence.
interesting that you describe black witness as ‚Äú per ‚Äú. says a lot about your mindset.
personal accounts are inherently unless you are talking about a large-scale study
. cops did not jump to conclusions, continued investigation. mob jumped to conclusions. mob rule
is there any forensic evidence that he went for the gun ?
there you go using common sense and logic ! üëç
maybe the ism they are motivated by is police racism.
wait. this brutality thing. is that because i like handcuffs and stuff ...? üò±üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
why was pd still looking for the suspect 7 hours after michael brown had been killed ?
i can not be racist because i have black friends ‚Äú trope. stop.
you are arguing with an idiot
proper investigation requires more than jumping to conclusions
where did you find this ?!?!?!?!?!?!
not jumping to conclusions but black people clearly hacked twitter to make up an excuse to riot
the same reason anyone else lies
congrats on your tweet !
and you know that he committed those crimes because ... the police said so
no such thing as reverse racism ' ... please go back to school.
well that could be. but are blacks that smart ?
. i weighed evidence as chair of board dealing with other legal matters, but same evidence rules.
perhaps the four did it and hillary clinton killed them to cover it up.
k. at least my mother did not raise a police brutality apologist.
you are not very smart. follow your own advice and stop jumping to conclusions
i do not believe your claim to have weighed anything. your evidence is anecdotal.
officers are trained to keep shooting until the threat is eliminated, it is not a game.
you jumped to conclusions about him resisting arrest (which is not a capital crime anyway)
it is a crime if he is dead he obviously does not need medical attention.
not jumping to conclusions or anything
i really should log need tell all my friends i am racist üòÇ
but now running away * is grounds for being shot
and this coming from the scholar that has used ' cracker ' way to keep it classy
you are jumping to conclusions moron. are you some dope that believes everything the govt tells you ?
. and fuck your respectability politics.
here is evidence to the contrary
good for your cracker friend. still does not negate the fact that its still standard procedure.
because proper investigation requires more than jumping to conclusions.
is a mob. a mob is a sandwich.

question for police chief ? if officer darren wilson was in pursuit of a robbery suspect , why tell kids
affluent people and those in authority take it as an affront to be questioned, especially by lesser people
it does not matter if you are policed, gang, or neighborhood watch. life means more.
police lied chief now says michael is friend was not involved in any robbery.
a riot not a robbery suspect apprehended.
1st interview mentions cigarillos amp ; told lawyer. video shows he gave back, not mike
cop administered street justice. ‚Äú execution for alleged robbery, no go !
a good question. i still think the cop was on drugs and hallucinating.
never mentioned robbery in his confrontation with them ... where is the corresponding dispatch call ?
robbers do not just stroll down the middle of the street after robbing a store. idiots
acted the same even over a bag of chips
of course not ... they have this fake police report, but no dispatch call detailing alleged robbery !
makes me wonder since robbery report filled out day later. also was cigarillo value raised ?
i am all types of confused.
you were correct yesterday ferguson police chief : officer did not stop brown as robbery suspect
that makes no sense at all.
they had 2 splice some tapes together.
and at least fife would have been honest from the first hour.
but they have had six days to come up with a narrative though !
never received emergency medical treatment, they left him in the street & amp ; labeled the event
. no narrative will justify actions after the 2d shot, surrendered, cop kept firing
that is what they took 4 days to concert ?... those 2 situations do not seem related at all
how convenient for this police chief .... he needs to just go
thing is killer cop knew nothing -was just being an asshole bully-started to leave backed up-killed kid
police lied ' police chief : officer did not stop brown as robbery suspect '
the problem is that some police and others believe in a concept of a free kill.
he is innocent of any death penalty offense. even if assault is involved.
there is a very fishy fishing expedition going on in looking for excuses for murder.
we need to the statement by officer wilson on what happened.
where there is just enough justification that a person thinks they can get by with it.
and that is cold blooded murder !
thank goodness the cops in are not very bright. makes it easier to sue their sorry asses !
agree those cops in are filled with so they hide behind military equipment, outrageous tactics
now another store video out that some say shows did pay 4 cigarillos - confusing
i say no more no matter who does it.
. is not this dispatch, and not ? created smokescreen knew it was murder !
someone needs to explain how the cop shot & amp ; then never called an ambulance ?
this shows paid for cigarillos. no robbery, no crime ! pls rt
is lawyer said in cnn interview dorian had admitted it as he gives his witness statement
and that attitude will be their downfall too. bet on it.
more like why was trying to pull into police car through the window ?
and his bullet would have been harmlessly in his pocket.
this is my fucking question !!!
cop never mentions shooting. dispatch never mentions robbery.
sadly friend of was in store also & amp ; has admitted to it
being shot 10 times in the street for stealing cigars is due process ? no arrest . no trial .
shut the fuck up you fuck stick ! ‚Äú you comment tells a lot about your character
i it is senseless.
truly. makes me so sick.
mike brown was wearing pants and gym shoes, not shorts and sandals.
call out to stl co police : only can confirm a person shot on chambers , and is down .
naturally assume the police shot. most if not all the gunshots fired have been the rioters
. please keep us in the loop ! want to know if this is continued in a or random
a woman is said to be shot in the head on chambers. also people wearing masks,
they attacked a peaceful protest with tanks and 300 military personnel
they attacked a peaceful protest with tanks and 300 military personnel ‚Äù
get out of their !
this seems that it will escalate even further before this is all over
i do not think it was by police, it was apparently a drive by
police say michael brown was robbery suspect , which totally explains why he got the death penalty without a trial
and assault. but who the ok cares about that, just some white dude. .
sign and share time to end police militarization now !
fox is pretty much vomiting this meme out with frightening glee
. it does explain why michael brown would fight w/police & amp ; require bullets to be stopped.
not even shoplifting some cigars.
sign and share time to end police militarization now !
i thought he was trying to steal my gum. ‚Äú self defense
while seems to be an offense punishable by police execution these days.
press conference had a police report claiming they thought he was an armed robbery suspect.
a rap song actually about police brutality ply listen and
in it does.
cop deserves a trial too - something that many seem to forget.
bunch of dirt bags with nothing better to do !
the of ' shoot ask questions later trial.
police engaged in character assassination to cover up actual assassination . you . simply . do not . shoot .
you talk about taking an officer is word over his ‚Äú friend ‚Äú ignoring that there are multiple eyewitnesses
well if i am being robbed who do i call : residents, or 911 ?
yeah there are multiple eyewitness accounts of a confrontation too, from what i read
thief is i mean
accounts that contradict the story you choose to believe. are you implying that all residents of that
in the case you mentioned, a reasonable person would not conclude their life was in danger
that is not the same as not being automatically trusting of police.
you were not there you have no idea what happened.
unarmed not dangerous. an unarmed chuck lid dell will still beat you to death.
ever. had. ass kicked by 300 lb teenager ?
you said i did not.
even if they grab for your gun ?
where did you hear these accounts to the contrary ? because every major new outlet i have seen reinforces
neighborhood are predisposed to being untrustworthy, criminal sympathizers ?
racism and fear pulled the trigger.
. you do not shoot unarmed people ever.
i was not implying that.
i said reasonable person, ‚Äú which is a standard term often defaults to.
it took the police 5 days to concoct this tale and this is what they came up with ?
the is conducting the investigation along with the do.
sponsored by the drudge report.
time to end police militarization now !
my favorite tweet of the day. üòùüòùüòùüòùüòùüòùüòù
and this ppm did not resist and are facing the punishment. what is your point.
regardless even if did alleged) the price 4 any scuffle should not be being murdered by cop
too much time fondling their weapons, no thoughts for plotting.
it took the police 5 days to concoct this tale and this is what they came up with ?
i would say complete lack of ninja in this situation.
time to end police militarization now !
but but but should not libertarians and pro-constitution people ... oh never mind
and of course she is a libertarian and ‚Äú pro-constitution ‚Äú
it has been released. in fact i will send you multiple links stating this
young black man something] criminal [something] deserves to die ...
she said who is felicia ‚Äú ?

evil and inept great combination for a pd

from jaywalking to strong-arm robbery . mhm ...

and the tin foil comes out .... what is your point ?
from jaywalking to robbery. mhm ...
all that means is store never set it.
time stamp on footage is wrong.
gonna do the lady he robbed now ?
look at the date ... if we share that the police need to share the truth really !!
but the store clerks ' lawyer made a statement
police are not criminals you and i are and the public.
some idiots photo shopped that june 9 date on there. seriously, research before spreading rumors
share this photo let the word spread !
then why did his friend confirm that they did steal from da store
dude shut the fuck up rt : ‚Äú : ‚Äù time stamp on footage is wrong. ‚Äù
was not it browns is friend who made the jaywalking claim ?
assuming and were involved in robbery , when can we expect president obama is apology to the pd ?
read the next time do not get me twisted.
a not matter his race has a right to defend himself against attack.
is that why their wearing red handkerchiefs
you are absolutely ignorance is not going to get you anywhere.
white people schooling blacks on race relations, is like me schooling stephen hawking about science.
same here. they are embarrassed by ferguson
when we get his birth certificate
what is holding all of mankind back is arrogant ignorant attitudes like yours.
i would like to talk to your black friends. hook me up.
guess what. bet they graduated high school first. why do so many drop out ?
we have laws against racism. they actually keep many white people from getting jobs.
that is much easier when you skin tone is the dominant one in society.
2. victims portray weakness and really are repulsive.
was signed nullifying the bill frights now ur not evenprotectedself incrimination no taking 5th
you have a master mentality.
slavery is only the beginning. blacks are still second class citizens.
why would he apologize to ferguson pd ? they still reacted with over militarized force to peaceful protesters !
a police officer is not judge, jury, and executioner.
it is like the alcoholic saying, ' poor me, pour me another drink ‚Äú
problem socialism is soon you run out of other peoples money
the woe is me. is holding some back.
i feel sorry for you. someday, you will see how it is not working for you.
same here. that slave mentality pays too well.
a distinction without a difference. i did read your words. you should choose them more carefully.
what did they peaceful people. tides turn.
maybe we should wait until after the funeral to start calling the man a criminal
oh please. it is enough.
look at all the corporations and governments that white men do not run anymore ... oh wait !
400 years of oppression that i am sure in you reply to this you will deny.
what view are you speaking of ?
assuming and were involved in robbery, when can we expect president obama is apology to the pd ?
this country is 237 years old. do you know that ?
did u c the black mo. hp officer speaking. now there is a leader.
how come the black people i know do not hold your views ?
u win. have a good day.
u mean as in the gang ‚Äú bloods ‚Äú ?
she wants to talk to our black friends so she could call them uncle tom is. watch out
no one said mike brown was a hero, why do you keep repeating that ?
now that makes no sense.
that is how old the constitution is. the first europeans settled here with slaves 1619.
because of that signed
yep. but this what some will call saint mike. no one can help that mentality.
why do you assume that ? and if it is true, the reaction far outweighed the action.
yes. a whole page of shooting gang signs. upstanding citizen. this is their hero
keep using the vetting company that ha vetted ' obama what did they expect !
i can condemn the actions of the police without condoning the actions of mike brown.
it really is a a mindset.
that was actually pretty funny cos. lol
now you are just making things up. i never said a word about socialism.
their lives. who is holding you back ?
that is tho. blacks can not be racist.
but i forgot that the constitution does not matter anymore anyway.
... that you would think was in by how police responded. treating it like a 9/11 situation.
victims never a law of life.
not getting anywhere here. talk later cos.
you are completely missing the point if you think anyone is calling him a hero or a saint.
police chief says officer darren wilson did not know was a robbery suspect
i am so freaking mad right now, they are lying in our faces.
so what was the point of releasing the fucking video sh.
this case needs to be looked over and the scumbag police officer needs to give up his badge
and no one know right now that he did not. we have to wait for facts
this lady says in the video the police took down security cameras where mike brown was shot
i am just saying that is what they will do in court
so he really is a cold blooded murderer. and he is still free. thanks america.
so police department can murder an 18-year-old for no reason at all.
come on now robbery ! stealing cigars is now considered a robbery !
so if he was with at the robbery why was not he in custody ? all media outlets interviewed him
this is why body cams on pigs do not work ! please re tweet
. gt gt ; because it did not happen.
pd made the suspect in that " robbery " police report . on what basis did they name him ?
every action taken by the pd post shooting has the appearance to me of a cover up.
i smell cover up whoever wrote the report is not that bright ! justice department needs to intervene
does the report identify the suspected robbers as being armed or not ?
they have a time stamped store video. is that enough for you ?
cause of the way it all unfolded
this is there 5 day cover up scheme, we do not buy it in sorry !!!
i think much worse than all those is the fact that it is all too familiar
there is no signature at bottom.
i will finish the sentence ... after the fact to cover their butts !
disgusting : mo chapter of klan raising money as ‚Äú reward ‚Äù for the officer killing .
why do members of the klein hide behind masks. be a man
not a shovel a ... spade low
this is a coward hiding behind a sheet !
what decade is this again ?! this is insane.
if he accepts that it will be an admission of guilt.
just wait if they find out the cop that shot brown was himself a black man
what the is wrong with this ppm ....... if its not zion is kkk
good folks of this town should disavow this fund raising.
cunt eats a bag of shit.
disgusting mo chapters of klein raising money as ‚Äú reward ‚Äù for the officer killing.
but the supreme court said racism no longer existed ! i am confused !
arrived in crestwood where officer darren wilson lives . when i knocked police officer rolled up and told me wilson
this requirement is rare in mo because there are 100+ municipalities all packed in to st louis county.
oh sir. sure come on in, ask away. what an idiot
do not the county have the same residency requirements as the city ?
good question. they have been pretty vague this far.
when will we find out what ‚Äú injuries ‚Äú he had ?
yeah. he is just sitting at home in a bath robe. what a dummy.
is everything about race to you. i did not mention race.
is probably hiding in the attic.
you i have other * paid * work to do.
i think it depends on the city, but it appears no for ferguson.
if it is the wilson from slip, his fm shows him in california
i am not sure how many municipalities require the officers to live in town.
i know that .... does anyone have personnel data for of wilson in ferguson ?
they gave him a head start.
still waiting for the name of the cop who never fled to be seen again !
pd is not slip.
i would leave too if a mob was screaming for my head before all the facts came out.
how can he leave he is a suspect in an ongoing investigation.
does that surprise they would get him far out of town b/4 riding him
yes. everything is about race to me.
people screamed for head. that zionist piece of shit is still walking the streets. stfu.
he is in drinking margaritas.
can you please give me an example of police accused of brutality who have been assaulted in last decade
can you please give me an example of a white person who has been lynched in the last century
did you seriously this he would be there ?
of course it is because you only see skin color not character ! of which your is questionable !
by all listen to these hypothetical cynics you mention. they sound very knowledgeable.
i never said was smart.
here is what the fop says on the topic :
police hand out info to make michael brown seem like a thug . but nothing on how he was actually
obviously with that question
if its true why would officer escalate a simple jay walking situation ?
i would not be dumb enough to protest without all the info in
strong arm robbery which means he was unarmed or no weapon implied.
that is not how that works. have you ever been a policeman ?
movie shooter in actually killed people. shoving someone is a lesser offense than killing multiple people.
seem to missed the unarmed part.
seeming is in the eye of the beholder.
seems like he was doing a lot of pushing others around.
seem like a thug some would say strong armed robbery = thug
protesting does not equate to your iq.
prefaced with if it is true ...
and where did you see them fighting or getting attacked ?
or ... is making a thug look innocent.
or he was a thug .....
he did not have a gun, he was unarmed
it did not just seem ‚Äú like he was pushing the store clerk.
does not matter how you preface it. its all speculation if you were not there.
did you have an issue with occupy wall street protest ?
a woman in was shot in head last night and released this selfie . conflicting reports of how it happened
as reported by injured in a random drive-by shooting per lt. col w/
when u spew hate of us balks camp ; lotus u she slavs

gm wow just old lotus all but n word on air. birthers
a woman in was shot in head last night and released this self. ‚Äù
we balk 4 lotuses see & gt ; racism runs deep

they just went aft lotus camp ; far 4 going on vacation ok whites do daily

my boy is a bit much. i just follow to get ridiculous shit like this.
a woman in was shot in head last night and released this self : ‚Äù
compelling photo. it is always miraculous to hear about a head shot victim surviving.
why would the officer tell to get out of the street if he was a suspect ?
are there any store surveillance tapes to prove this ‚Äú gerry-rigged ‚Äú strong arm robbery theory ?!?
why would the officer tell getting out of the street if he was a suspect ?
why not mention this ‚Äú strong arm robbery suspect ‚Äú status in the very beginning ?
why would the police chief say there was an ambulance when
that makes the pd is original statement seem contradictory does not it
officer may not have even known. just being a murderous jerk.
ferguson pd now admits that darren wilson did not know anything about the store robbery when he stopped mike brown
that is what i am trying to figure out.
huh that makes total sense to me. spare me ....
that was their only sliver of hope. repercussions need to be huge.
it was the mm that inferred this. what is your point ?
they said he confirmed he stole them sh !
how can you be sure its bad ? mike could have freaked out thinking different
means nothing about whether the violent thug assaulted him.
well he has his friend calling radio stations saying he did know low which is it ?
wow ! what was the point of bring out the robbery footage today if it had nothing to do with
the enemy enjoys chaos and confusion. the video will serve that purpose.
because the press demanded it with for, he answered that question 5 times
such a great point they are trying to defame him.
what if that clerk were your dad ? hmmm ?
pray for us in st. louis region everyday minorities face character assassination
just to throw dirt on the victim !
officer involved should be charged the victim had surrendered and was shot execution style
to stop the people watching.
the police chief is a 5 star general in projection , imagination and deflection ... took a week to hatch
did not the store manager say on saturday that he was not involved ?
they think we will be ok with what happened if they say a black man did it. smh
exactly ... and now going into the second.
preach. . it was so fake !!
someone with better eyes than me please on the bottom left photo . is not that june ?
it says 9 2014 sh

someone with better eyes than me please on the bottom left photo. is not that june ?
you can see it better in the pic is on the left, 8/9
yes it says .... what the hell

yeah it appears to be a bunch of bs that definitely is not brown
the dude in the pix is wearing different clothes than. so someone pointed out the date looked ???
it says cam 6 2014-08-09
* if * the report was written same day as the shooting , as bungling as cops have been ,
store owner and robbery witness id would brown. they prob had this info within hours
also ..... on tuesday chief jackson told me brown was not being stopped in ... ‚Äú
oh my god. what imbeciles.
should not there have also been a warrant for his arrest out if their story was true ?
not for brown because it all happened in the same day, but why not for johnson ?

dear ....... are you really sure this gun thing you have got going is working ?
i had no idea that resisting arrest for walking in the street can get u shot to death
i am glad people are finely starting to see through the medias and cops bs and leis
so how does that justify murder ? corruption from within ! dont let em fool ya !
pitiful what a farce !
60 is in mississippi or alabama.
they desecrated is body then they desecrated his memory and plight for justice . explain this .
the coroners ' car was blocked by protesters.

q : " why did he stop michael brown ? " police chief : " because they were walking down
rt right. rt blocking traffic on an empty street inside a neighborhood ... got it
right. rt blocking traffic on an empty street inside a neighborhood ... got it
blocking traffic on an empty street inside a neighborhood ... got it
that is a pretty good reason to shoot some one
witness to shooting atty confirms brown took cigars from store . client told fbi he " did take cigarillos "
not a justification for death penalty. arrests are also not made through car doors.
but it is amazing how white serial killers get safely taken into custody to live off my tax dollars
did this comment really seem appropriate ? i pray for lost souls with more opinions than sense.
so the community goes nuts for a thug ?
this disgusting ... stop it is alleged.
a mugger got shot. damn the truth shall set you free
17 year old unarmed kid shot ten times by police for stealing candy . i did not know that was
it is if someone starts assaulting an officer
this is or should be.
these days ' especially with stand your ground and even a sneeze is punishable by death.
. we do not even know that he stole any candy.
anything is punishable by death if the youth is black.
ten times for stealing candy ? god have mercy !
it applies to black people.
agreed should be charged w/murder !!
. this story makes me physically sick.
this is simple : if was a robbery suspect , why didn‚Äôt police say that on day one ? why
exactly smells fishy to me. they are trying to cover up their own tracks.
they had to get their lie straight
the police said time x again he was a robbery suspect
exactly what i was thinking. do they think we are that dumb ?
and if he was why did not they apprehend the boy that was with him ?
why did he cont to shoot after his hands were raised ? thats where this is a clear murder
follow me. ill follow back asap. (not spam) !
they are killing the victim again
great point why did not they arrest his ‚Äú accomplice ‚Äú if they were robbery suspects ?

since fbi is investigating the shooting , is not darren wilson a fugitive & amp ; the cops who let
yes that is what they say until your cleared in the investigation !
. what kinda police let murder suspect leave town ?
when there is an investigation and your a suspect. your still told not to go anywhere.

if no one knows where he is, and he killed someone, what else can we call him
only kind i have heard do that.
are not you an idiot and your progeny all retards ?
but he is white and a cop so nah
well no he is not a fugitive charges have not been pressed
yep. they definitely do.
i believe that was a different officer. there was no mention of an assault rifle.
oh he will definitely have to be back soon. or maybe he never really left ...
is there a warrant i think has to be warrant for arrest to be fugitive
i really hope holder is going to work out all his years of frustrations on these creeps.
you do not want that. i am not a criminal lawyer !

exactly . why release the video if stopping mike brown was not related to the robbery ? jesus christ this
look up the freedom of information act (foil) . media must understand media law.
not exactly. he could have shot him dead for blocking traffic.
they claim they released the tape because it was a foil request * enters side eye *
because people who commit robberies are less likely to deal on friendly terms with police.
then they ran he pursued. rest is history.
but that means officer had no legitimate reason to interact with, do not you think ?
chief says media requested it ‚Äú ; media has no idea it existed
mt the police should have covered up mike brown is robbery ! ‚Äú
it speaks to his and to his state of mind ten minutes later.
violence , brutality , suppression of free speech . attacks on journalists . yeah . let is believe everything the

truth and justice must be demanded ...
right ... mike could have paid for it as well ...
yep. its all about the video now and murderer darren wilson is a non factor.
it is time for citizens of ferguson to demand his resignation and appoint a competent person instead.

good thing someone knew the real one you fucking losers
big corp media reports false news daily.
but every anonymous is a moms-basement-dwelling ass clown.

so , many of those calling for transparency yesterday are condemning police for what they released today . can‚Äôt have
these people probably consider themselves ‚Äú pro-life ‚Äú as well (unless it is a black person)
another racist who just has to believe that the black person got what they deserved. you are disgusting
and the threat of public execution for being gay
is there a death penalty for theft ? did not think so
nigger is racist but cracker is not ?
his partner amp family lawyers both admitted it was him robbing the store.
cop is awareness is not the point. violent felonious behavior and a reason to resist arrest are.
really who has bcz even the store owner said it was not.
the store clerk would have done them since saturday, i would assume.
reports are now that the officer was responding to the call, i thought ...
thank i will stay right here and fight an increasingly oppressive gov not
yea because nothing says freedom like a racist lotus who throws a tantrum because he did not get candy
and black people will do anything to defend bad behavior
police should not be shooting unarmed black boys and men. get it through your racist heads.
because it shows that this ‚Äú kid ‚Äú was not an innocent bystander
i agree it is a diversion
white ppm will say anything to justify the murder of black people
but they want it both ways. new day, same old crap.
but they have not released anything ... related to the shooting execution that is ...
you can if you are a lib !
says his felon friend
and you were there that from his ‚Äú felon friend ‚Äú
he was. he was unarmed with his hands raised.
and please remember there is no proof he has his hands up.
i am done arguing w u. ur dumb. white. and ugly. bye.
no more facts ' huh ? resort to name calling ... good job.
getting shot in the back ? are you fucking kidding me ? what is your damage ???
at you thinking those are mutually exclusive
another view administration could be as transparent as promised and legitimately condemned for info they release.
do not even bother he is been calling me a racist all day.
but brown was aware of it.
you are the disgusting animal
and cops will do anything to get away w murder.
your point is what.
police should only release information that meets the narrative.
yeah little 6'4 293. so tiny you are right
you can not be angry at the truth ? ok ...
no but if you are going to commit a felony be prepared for consequences
racist trash showing its true colors. do everyone and favor and remove yourself from the earth.
it was actually 6'4, 293
accountability you rob a store, be prepared for the consequences
since when is 6-2 and 250lbs ‚Äú little ‚Äú ?
no but a felon at 6'4, 293 is quite a threat yes
. sure you if you are a democrat, that is.
confirmed that he and brown were in that video. so - fact, yes ?
you meets the progressive left ‚Äú narrative
you have no idea who that is. are you really this sick ?
should we execute now since we know he took money illegally ?
great so shoot execute him ! right ?
what was released today mentioned nothing about the shooting. so there still is a lack of transparencies.
you assume that seeing one black teen in a video means any black teen is suspect ?
why do you white people get such raging boners when black people are murdered ?
that would be you. get your shit twisted cracker.
you rob a you get the death penalty with no due process ? ok got it !
tell me there is some explanation, however lame !
is there proof of that ? or is that what the cops said ?
maybe they should unleash polices on wall st. that is where the big thieves are.
mist innocent people rob you are an idiot
18 yrs years old amp ; unarmed is not a big threat is it ?
yeah and unfortunately some people will not be happy unless they can commit genocide against ‚Äú whitey ‚Äú
of course you could not care less. you are white.
his friend so does not mean anything. whole discussion is a diversion from execution.
he was unarmed. i still do not see a threat.
i am not black. you are a racist. eat shit.
sure they can. on race issues they always do have it both ways.
racists always out themselves talking shit about obama. its all you got
exactly. anything to keep us distracted.
you are blocked amp ; reported ass-wipe. 0 followers hahn
he was not attacking when he was shot in the back ... or was he ? da dash daaaaaah
where exactly are you getting the ‚Äú truth ‚Äú ? the racist corporate owned media ? hahahahahaha !!!
an animal is not a threat until he is cornered, then they will do anything to live
if this little kid ‚Äú was so good, why did not he obeys the officer ?
no proof he robbed the store ?
do not be disingenuous. what they released today was some bullshit and most everyone knows that.
the robbery does not justify the shooting. but it does make claim of gun-grabbing less unlikely.
can you send me a link to this ‚Äú confirmation ? ‚Äú
bullshit facts that i do not like. . .
do your research dip shit. i do not have time to educate ignorant racists like you
you are a moron. bye bye.
who is life was he threatening u dummy ? he was unarmed. stop being so white.
you do not seem to have a grasp on the general reaction
and please remember there is no proof he robbed the store.
you clearly have a limited understanding both of transparency and accountability.
you are a dumb cunt. get bent you pampered bitch.
you do not know them very well. .
they have confirmed this is him. so if the truth makes me sick ....

tell me about this black tank commander is civil rights when he got back from vietnam ?
11 percent of the population, 12. 6 percent of the soldiers in vietnam
absolutely. but knowing they are on camera will make some think twice at brutality before they act.
that pool to believe but if the system is not equal for/to all ...........
they were trained by the if (israel) . we are all palestinians now.
listen 2 the piercing words of the mother in
this is what i mean by ‚Äú the system ‚Äú.
ah you found me out. i believe all people are created equal. terrible, i know.
all pundits are like flies in a hurricane in the information age. we do not need them !
makes this issue colorblind. no the fuck it ai not
we would have noticed but took his ribbon out of his avid.
' cops r doing as told ' why do we believe d justice system will go after them.
what does it take to put the on trial ? why r the not yet arrested ?
i would like to stop pretending it is post racial !!!
if you have to always ‚Äú police the police then the police are the problem not the citizens
i mussel on the one and he is arrogant as all get out.
take may god bless.
what happened in our unit in vietnam cannot change what happened when got back home
you use ethnic minorities as cannon fodder in most combat zones.
training may be required for armed dangerous drug dealers but not unarmed teens
thats the point why 2 & amp ; not 4 ???
not everyone sees your entire conversation. looks like a generalization, by careful
it is not just what the gov not considers murder. it is a fact.
why are not state laws correcting the problem b4 the feds show up ???
if that was then after milk everything ‚Äú should have been ‚Äú pool, right ?
missed where she compared his murder 2 police killing dogs ! i am pissed ...
yes it is the feds who typically have to move in when you have a corrupt local dept.
really wow somehow i tank that was an insult ... but even u can dream !
why the hell does have branches in foreign nations.
. is the only victims in the world the rest of us are not shit ...
that is always been the case. the police was never our friend
bullets until the entire front facade caved in ... so he can not tell me at police or military
is in many countries not just israel, and has been there for years.
as long as that same system that deny reality is in place ........
irrelevant. the disproportionate number of minorities in front line situations is very telling.
not about race idiot or racist, either way you are blocked, .
the definition of murder does not change based upon the race of those being killed or killing.
did not compare any such thing. used it to point out trigger happiness.
murdered that was a quick trial. screw due process, am i right ? üòÉüëç
gotta go get some stuff done. god bless.
preach they are elevating distraction to a science
agreed can work with if.
not everyone is like you. just yell and block.
then we need to work on this fast before it spirals out of control
this training issue is a deflection, its excessive use of force. cops should be on trial
this whole discussion will away matter !!!!!
could even walk in white restaurant or be seen w/a white woman w/o being shot when

damn. i am glad you posted that article.

yes yes and that is why ‚Äú daily ‚Äú mass distraction is key.
from plantation to economic. white supremacy is sinister, dangerous
i am very happy i missed that bs.
what is this rt ‚Äú : che this out- sgt ; nypd in israel - sgt ;
maybe they want to improve on their police brutality skills by seeing how the foreigners do it.
cuss away if it makes u feel better.
i guess only huh ?
of it is are right 2 do anything as u c fit. my bad
. so are you claiming it is not about race ? a simple yes or now will do.
an no i am not happy about the ferguson shooting.
u guys take care. church duty calls.
unless it considers wall street (capital of capital) its most important beat.
2 of those cops went to jail for a long time.
u do as u wish. it is totally been right. my bad 4 bothering u
they get really irked when they read something that challenges their racist world view.
remember professional organizations should not have to be policed.
i stopped watching them awhile back.
why would they need of combat training in for r streets unless their planning something
but we and people like me had no control over that.
i crossed tony with the innocent boy who was murdered by police. sorry about that.
really there is nothing wrong with voting for you congressman/woman, governor, state legislators
because he is the cop shot ten times instead of five or six.
yup. no one gives a shit about their pods
it took everything in me not 2 curses - sgt ; this lunatic out !
we he no social leaders most r out chasing booty. no martinlkings or malcolm.
i would list them all as well ! twitter 140 characters ! lol
u have seen d cage fifth this training is similar. why go2 israel ?
good but if you consider paid leave/vacation time winning. jail time is winning !!!!
the senseless violence against blacks is widespread, every state, every police unit
judging from his he does not exactly fit in with any racist groups !
yeah they are few amp ; far between ...
cooperative efforts are reasonable in light of modern concerns. but their reach is too extensive.
and then were tried for civil rights violation. not all went to jail but 2 did.
gathering to help our city.
fair enough. but it shows the military was, and still is institutionally racist.
i follow you for a reason, trying to protect your credibility.
watch your manners. i road around vietnam dmz with black tank commander, do not generalize !
is a sin. just my opinion
it is how many white ppm has the usa blown up lately ?
you understand class issues as well. correct üòí
king had a video tape and the system still let the cops off !!!!
i do not need a history lesson on how many bulk soldiers in vietnam, not one of them
agree with or chick responds with reasonable intelligence
and hence hell on earth home !!!
i am always open for good dialogue.
wait until you hear this mess ! they are talking about drones in philadelphia.
are you still talking nascar ?
of he should not be shooting at all.
nothing is perfect but at least it would be a start.
not surprised. they got drones on the border
i know i am not entertained. people are starving out there while wall street turns bigger profits !
us can train cops adequately. r a threat, they must go to court.
their training shoot the in d chest so why they need martial art training
no yelling here. but i will block quick & amp ; fast.
thought so. enjoy your tea.
we have tools now we never had- cameras and internet get the story out. publicized without networks.
these days social leaders can be female n will emerge from social media activists
we have a problem !!!!
again the problem is not cameras it is the system !!
if he were white or light skinned, the cop would shoot, but fewer times.
was waiting for someone called ' killer ' to start defending a murderous copper.
nope true. they got off at first.
i definitely feel u charlie. study candidates & amp ; hold them responsible
sensibility amp rational thing sold have been what the cops used b4 murdering
martial arts training does not allow u to kill the vulnerable
no no those with the most power must be policed. always !
there was economic this changed the filter.

their fitted out like a seal team. wow
what is the chances of seeing what is on all of their helmet cams that they have been using
wow i can not believe this is on the streets of america
is that in ?
when fear is not enough to control the american public. they bring in people to force control.
why are all those cops dressed like they are going to play soldiers ?
tax dollars paid for that equipment to harass and harm citizens
i sense a cauldron ?
the police dept did not say " murdered " of course . cops never " murder " people . black
in beaver creek police shot a black male and are calling it murder. so should ferguson.
i would not deny that
sounds like an awful version of the phrase ‚Äú his body ran into my bullets ten times ‚Äú
oh right because white are murder. this is the most ignorant statement i have read.
the lady before was which does not help in such circumstances
that is not just that applies to everyone too.
so if the officer was black this would not be an issue ?
that is kind of my point though. that statement should have never singled out a specific race.
murder requires intent ; imo, given disturbances, pretty reckless to incite w/o clear facts
accusing people of murder before a conviction is a particularly stupid way to waste taxpayers money
law enforcement agents can‚Äôt commit crimes because we only draft heroic ubermensch into their ranks
i think you mean before they are charged, which is just an accusation by the state.
i have read quite a few more actually ...
i would agree with that think your original wording could be better.
time to end police militarization now !
more on the language of police shootings, by
that happens to not just black people.
yep and in this case it was an execution
but such is the ...
murder in is impossible ; * unqualified * murder with conditional intent also
are you aware that the officer that shot is also black ?
. police love using the passive voice, it is almost like they did not do anything
murder unlawful premeditated killing of a human being by another. until proven guilty, law presumes innocence
mike is father used the proper verb : ‚Äú executed ‚Äú
never forget : tear gas . rubber bullets . apcs . militarized cops . no name tags . no fly

first black people on stealing makes people think all black people steal not me
and its possible he did not.
why do not you ask yourself if you really have to given he was shot in the back 1st
good point. also as a race we need to confront racism whenever its apparent
no i am not saying they savage but yes they are making there selves look that way
why not release the full report ? why is the burden of proof against the victim ?
being if you are going to try to make a point spell correctly.
a show to squash the resistance movement period in this country --- sgt ;
then you should already most police feed in2 the stereotype n see isolated incidents as a collective
if you want to be taken seriously you need to use words correctly
that is not hard to believe
the cops come it is always the cops fault right like i said it is you wrong
knowing the kid is not the point. even if he grabbed the gun no excuse
wow so he deserved to died because of ‚Äú parenting skills ‚Äú ? i am done. peace man
you so funny i can exactly say i knew better so i did better
no because good parents have there kids at home like i said you guys do not no his life

no killing him is not his job i am just saying let is get the facts
an unarmed person who presented no apparent threat was shot multiple times period.
you only say that because you do not want to force the black man to change
true ... but sometimes it is ...
come on. think wisely before you try to be so smart.
can we just wait and see and not be so quick to think it a conspiracy
i am sorry we as black people are taught to hate the cops so who do we believe ?
no i do not believe anybody i just think we all should wait for the facts
topical thing people do not want the truth they start putting you down
our hold life as a race because of the failure of the back man
we are t taught to hate cops. isolated incidents and personal experiences make us look at them differently
surplus military gear these start tactics of fear. mental states change
and that is why a lot not all but a lot of these things happen
no it is just shows in the black community there is known one parenting or teaching
everything is wrong with that !!!!! do u hear yourself ?
lynch would be so proud of you kelvin ! u are living proof.
look at the mail box ...
so they can threaten cop that is the only reason be honest
and you are right as all people we need to confront racism but who will confront it
just ask yourself do you even really know this kid
no i just do not follow hype what is wrong with that
for them shooting him that many times. it has nothing to do with race
the fact that the police still have not interviewed the young man that was with mike, is nuts
again you are using your mindset. stop generalizing. we are not you !
you guys make it about race by acting out
maybe we should give them a chance and stop with the race card all the time
you might but more than half do i just do not get why everybody mad over the truth

perfect example of what you get when you do not vote.

speak for yourself. i assume nothing about no one. i simply take reasonable precautions.
if 10,000 people have to die so that 600,000,000 peoples ' right to defend themselves then so be it
people that are racist should not be allowed to own guns.
in your what percent of the people in nyc were carrying ?
i loved in the office and had to explain myself to people. it was fun.
it is my right to have em get over it crybaby.

friends , the police are not incompetent . they are building a defense & amp ; know they do not
the defense does not even need to make sense, racist white people will fill in any blanks.
the sad thing from their perspective, this is the system working.
that is what has had me torn up all morning/afternoon ...
they are digging their own graves, shoplifting for $3 at most does not justify killing an armed child
incompetent in some we saw that, but cops know how to handle this part.
not interviewing key eye witnesses tells you basically all you needed to know.
y'all might dig this an impromptu recording of mine from last night & gt ;
after this week they will need to work. nobody is gonna buy their story.

to compare these sadists 2 soldiers insults soldiers.

neither cops nor it would appear !
needed experts for that conclusion ?? // : experts say police tactics have made tensions worse
do not try to redeem yourself now, the world knows who keeps the lights on at cnn.
share it if you against police brutality
no one needs an expert to see the fact that the police escalated this situation !
well if up to no good then ur going to get shot.
mt cops or soldiers ? experts say police tactics made tensions worse | no shit
. those who fail to study history are doomed to repeat it.
military tactics in learned from plus investigate ! see 2011 st. louis county pd press

in what country did this happen ?
sadly the politicians selling out the country are just greasing this slippery slope. kudos they were representing
every day from now on will be let the movement begin please re tweet
glad to see the militarization of police has worked so well.
i can not help but notice that no one with the or has suggested the protesters should carry assault rifles
may be they should. this is exactly the case 2nd amendment was intended for
was not behind that and many of us opposed buddy. but keep assuming we are psychos.
well aware rank and file nra members are not as extreme as the leadership.
or that they have not shown up.
can you imagine the horror ?! black pals carrying guns ?! did suggest guns for protection from rioters.
because those rubber bullets would have been lead ones if anyone demonstrates were armed
my guess is that they would gladly volunteer to harass alongside the cops
i think the main point of the protest is to be unarmed.
agreed. but the point is still valid.
except with buddy and his lunatic supporters confronting federal police ... they do not count though, right ?
why does that make us psychos ? are ns all psychos ? why is fighting back not allowed ?
it is almost like we are not psychos who think people confronting police should do so with weaponry.
just a gun nut who would enjoy a good blood bath
deafening silence from the clive buddy defenders
yup we should be peaceful !
you ... you seem confused. or grasping at straws. either way, i am not interested.
has said that the police abuse is why citizens should be armed.
that is because it contradicts everything the nra has said and done up to this point.
i will be damned ... * scratches head * why is that ???

the shooting in highlights why the federal government should be underwriting body cams for all cops rather than military gear
or they could just prosecute them. i know, crazy talk.
exactly. force goes down and complaints go down.
all cops should have cams, tech is there, cheap too.
i agree and rigid procedures used by officers can acerbate issues with pops such as the mentally i will
if you read my previous tweets i said training is needed in these areas.
that has been recommended for decades. still not happening. police in america are out-of-control.
there are good ones and bad ones like any other professions including professors like us.
the vest cameras can help convict thug cop murderers and separate them from those in more volatile situations.
cops in have them but some refuse to use them. they are not disciplined for it either.
b camp w police culture, militarization, impunity, all contribute.
if you read my previous tweets i said there is police brutality that is a simple fact.
true ... it seems everything is a battle ugh !! praying about it
and it also filters out false allegations - which happen. win win.
it is not about mental illness or training, it is about structural racism.
actually jurisdictions are adopting cameras rapidly. the privacy issues, which are legit, are getting worked out
would like to interview you about this. can you email me ?
that is otherwise the technology will always ‚Äú malfunction ‚Äú when needed the most.
your observation may not be relevant here but there is truth to massive challenge of mentally ill and policing
twit is suspended act. web still up v
they are not social addiction specialists, or mental health counselors
shooting the not the noun.
prosecuting would be very but cameras would stop many before they killed more young black men.
i am in no way condoning police brutality but not all situations are cut and dry
and its against the constitution to militarize the police. i mean not that they abide
police here in get training in all those things and they rarely shoot people. imagine that.
yes they are trained to see all situations in black and white no gray and that is a problem
i know this is not a popular opinion but we ask cops to do too much besides policing
how this is relevant to the multiple shooting of an unarmed black kid escapes me
that is been my whole point the whole time

we do not know he assaulted a cop. witness accounts dispute the police version.
but the cop is on trial ? on twitter ?
children is lives have absolute value regardless of behavior or race.
he pushed the cashier. he was nowhere near the officer when shot. no longer a danger.
sure he is. look at him
officer did not know about robbery ; unarmed & amp ; nowhere near officer means deadly force unnecessary
aw i enjoyed the hell out of performing it ! i hope it comes around again !
asked and you are exactly the point of this statement.
i think you are missing the point. two wrongs do not make a right.
but not worth being murdered.
still no reason to kill him.
the fuck asked ???
. he is not exactly filled with compassion. best just to ignore him.
even is supreme religious leader is now on twitter condemning the us as a whole for ferguson ...

y‚Äôall notice & amp ; st louis county have not released the autopsy report . trajectory of bullets matters in
not making anything personal. that is general comments aimed at the issue.
these facts r but facts none less. build stronger fans based on moral values is answer
every race in has moral issues ! it is not just a problem of black morals.
a close personal friend went from losing a job and everything, to being homeless.
of all blacks killed are killed by other blacks. where are the protests for that ?
when killing someone for sneakers or drugs is acceptable, we have a problem.
reason nothing changes is 2 many people r 2 busy claiming victim status instead of working hard.
just tired of race hustlers in media & amp ; govt ' that booker t warned us about :
it all comes back to slavery ?
most people of all races only want blacks to succeed and thrive !
i am not justifying cops who go overboard however.
no she thinks is racist and its all america is fault, her community has no responsibility.
everybody will have to atone for the part they play. everyone.
because our population is smaller. yep ! you are right.
that there is a huge other problem ! trust me, i spend countless hours mentoring about that !
well said those are eternal principles upon which we can all build our lives upon !
so you do not think the welfare state plays a role in this, or personal responsibility ?
no but blaming others & amp ; not taking personal responsibility has multiplied problems for blacks.
it is toxic. big government is at the root of the problem.
look at the stats for certain crimes. federal prison is overwhelmingly white for white collar crimes.
i want you check out this documentary please and thanks !
when will an arrest take place ?
but that is for every race in america, not just blacks.
i but they are way over represented.
behind every successful family is a proud, strong supportive hard working wife.
me too much love and respect to all who participated in this conversation.
tell her you are helping to save the county, and we appreciate all of your hard work !
come on u know stop snitching ' is a big problem in the black community :
life is hard for everyone.
start rebuilding teaching find god, pursue education, teach hard work pays.
family 10 need restoration. its the bedrock. education too.
then i do not think this conversation can go any further.
what would the country look like without the police. be glad you have them.
number of entrance points
and that has nothing to do with race. has everything to do with families and values.
welfare dependency has more to do w/ it. before 1964 blacks marriage rate was higher than whites.
maybe because it is an ongoing investigation.
is right. it stems from breakdown of families and values, leading to amorality.
need more leaders that stress gd choices, not ones who promote strife and victim hood.
it plays a part. there is always a starting point, the history of a problem.
blacks are victims of big government, leftist, progressive ideas and policies !
i agree completely but we also need a full investigation of what happened in.
thats not relevant. majority of all felony inmates are one race. their community is in crisis.
boom that says it all. you are right.
i thought i was the only who had that problem !
i just said that yesterday ! those on the system make politicians rich !!!
but blacks are not the highest % of welfare recipients.
we escaped a communist country where our land was stolen/friends imprisoned & amp ; never looked back.
absolutely there is a difference between living off of the government and caring for the real poor.
if there were more intact homes, then there would be less of need for a police presence.
we are all and we all need to repent and take responsibility for our own actions.
if the dispatch time line matches that point we do agree. still not justify shooting.
wives are a very powerful group ! lol ! our membership has it is perks !
but just like all there is a root.
yes this police chief is pitiful.
the video does nothing more than justify the stop. it does not justify the shooting.
and marriage is the best anti-poverty program there is !
when a life of crime is more appealing than work and school, we have a problem.
we have to be honest about that breakdown, or else we get nowhere !
amen. it is what takes the place of fathers and husbands in broken communities.

my question is what is the best detergent to used to clean white sheets ?
officer did not know anything about the robbery
does it explain why the officer shot brown 2-3 times while brown is hands was raised ?
is running after and chasing some1 with a loaded gun illegal ? as george admitted he did
what are you talking about ?
a lot. it is believed the officer emptied his gun.
can i ask you serious question ?
it explains why brown would assault the officer.
never said that but that is what you wanted to hear.
the police chief said that in his presser this afternoon
are you fucking stupid or just completely bat shit insane ?
is that a question ?
can i ask you a real serious question ?
walked away ... for four minutes .... then came back to show how bad he was
and here comes wondered how long it would take
that is what i think happened. based on what i know so far.
this is disgustingly dismissive and insensitive ... ugh
it is clear we are going backwards in race relations in this country
the initial narrative about turned out to be far different once the facts came out in court.
once again you feel caused his own death
oh lord ... only if i can grade your question on how serious it actually is.
so the policeman had a reason to stop brown. why was he in car ?
you recall the initial narrative about that shooting ?
elder you really are an uncle tom.
he matched description of suspect in robbery 10 minutes earlier :
how many times was brown shot ?
the botched that case and had no intention of convicting george
so that warrants an on street death penalty where is the pic of officer wilson ?
no it does if that is what happened.
that is how the struggle over the sidearm occurred.
and has no words for those grieving families
let me ask you a question : what do you think happened ?
the jury never viewed rayon as a human being
these pix and his very long arrest record might shed light on the situation ;
seriously is it clorox with beach ?
better than being a racist like yourself.

the message is here pup - agenda 21 (official single) :

then people started burning shit down
are you retarded police was like that from day 1 even when peaceful.
last thing grieving oppressed people want to see is the oppressor trying to intimidate.
. is it safe to assume they are not the is bankers/corrupt regulators/loan sharks/pols who tanked our economy ?

mound city bar association has agreed to donate their time pro bono , for any witnesses that would like to
see and what happened to the man who recorded the death and his family.
why would a witness need an attorney ?
riots hurt property values and ruin communities . deters business from coming -- then same " activists " complain ,
then why do not the ‚Äú activists ‚Äú condemn the looters ? because condemnation is reserved for police.
would you love someone who murdered your son for walking down the street ?
police are activists racist murdering activists. how does that affect house prices ??
hey look it is an uncle tom !
why do not you like women ??? why do you support murdering racist pigs ?
murdering unarmed teens ruin communities and deters businesses
how do you know they are not ? in populations of this size intent and pop are not homogeneous
assumes that the activists and the looters are the same people. a sadly myopic assumption.
precisely. prejudice prejudgment. prejudice ! = racism, though they are kissing cousins.
many black urban centers never recover after riots of the late 1960 is
i do not get it - if you are going to riot why destroy your own neighborhood ?
. do murderous white men need the support of a nigger. that is my question.
misogynist fatherless homes criminal homes ... you got a problem with women ??
sad and wrong. the majority of activists live in. most of the arrested looters do not-
police murdering people hurts communities. fuck property values. a kid is dead.
of course i would. what is the matter w/you ? stop defending anarchy.
stop using logical fallacy. nobody is defending anarchy nor justifying looting. re-read. activist ! = looter
that is for ya why do you think ?! it is that same liberal !
says someone who obviously peaked in the 60s.
well riots would not happen if ya stop murdering black people.
hey that is a cute baby.
do murdering unionized cowardly mobs of need the support of a nigger ?? that is my question.
thug behavior is a crime committed by a few that the whole community pays for
if protesters were white , they would be walking away with several hundred cattle and an apology .
for the record i am completely disgusted by the way michael brown is death has been handled ...
if protesters were they would be walking away with several hundred cattle and an apology.
re convoy earlier. this is not in st. louis, and the crowd is mainly white :
the riot is the result of lethal inequity. the militia were not being targeted by police.
you are no comparison.
were grazing their cattle on public land. they committed a crime. no comparison 2
your reach for a valid comparison exceeds your grasp. stop now.
remember the pictures from the gop and dem conventions ? were those militarized police forces racially motivated ?
arrest moocher rancher buddy. send the tanks to wipe out the militia
they owed the fed gov not. everyone knows that.
makes the contrast in responses that much more maddening
you‚Äôre trying to compare a speculative homicide to a dispute over land ownership ? come on now.
it is good to know !
people are not permitted to break laws bc cops murdered michael brown.
we got you featured on
the ranch is in u know nothing about either situation. g'bye
i guess the rioters will just have to be content with the loot from walmart.
your hypothetical support not at issue. police response to race is.
and some protesters are throwing rocks at police and torching blogs. does not mean warrants military.
riots are not regardless of the justification.
burn in hell you racist cunt
that is the whole point.
lot of them are done not trust media bc all they feed you be propaganda bullshit
and they would be armed to the teeth.
yet the militia types were permitted to aim their weapons at police w/out consequence. no comparison.
dude you are missing the point
we are white as well. i live here. this goes much deeper than race.

police are the arbiters of the law not suppressors
or ? photos unmask the militarization of america is police via
yes indeed. of protector are peaceful
do you really think us govt is your government, govt only for european american not anyone else.
hope asks them that essential question.
this is selective militarization of america is policed, happening at but not at why ? rt
yes these ugly ppm somehow think it is ok 2 h8 out loud b/c presidents while black !
that is because the black communities are under attack, from our own government.
or photos unmask the militarization of america is policed via
believe me i know there not my government.
the majority of our nation is not racist/haters but that 25% more or less promotes it non stop !
sure looks like a lot of protecting and serving going on in either case üòê
murder of any race is wrong, but you might not know that.
has been going on since 9/11/2001. homeland security money gone terribly wrong !
welcome to where americans started waking up to the militarization of their police force
always fun watching racist morons defending stuff they would be outraged about if it were aimed at non-blacks.
... would have been dispatched by those protecting themselves, family, neighbors, and property.
thanks for the compliment
your stupid is metro.
what about the media not being allowed in certain areas ? keep ignoring the creeping oppression and police state
are not they prove me wrong.
try again i already condemned rioting, police are arresting ppm protesting not rioting
libertarianism principle law enforcement = licensed aggression. how can they be reconciled ?
good have added it to my website, thanks
all the police state fantasy bs that rifting gun nuts believe threatens them is actually happening to black.
i knew who you were talking about, i am aware that you are ok with police brutality
and when it happens to buddy then they care and are for resistance
eye witnesses said this guy was just walking home and police arrested him because ...
i have no idea what you mean by that tweet
what you on about detroit. city of bankruptcy ?
i tweeted earlier about being peaceful and filming the police at all times in these situations
i think peaceful demonstration is needed but i get the knee jerk reaction
opposite is true ask who got more done than malcolm x is violent rhetoric
i did not mean the police. i meant the looters
might be more appropriate that worked out pretty well imo
when blacks loot and burn down towns, then yes, this response is warranted.
libertarianism promotes neither liberalism nor conservatism, it promotes logic. rioting is not inherently logical.
it is all the same police control
i just hope for humanity he is a paid troll and does not believe this
that is then. i do not like apologists for scummy, savage backward behavior.
stop. looting. shop is. and. get. a. job. then.
that is a separate issue which must be addressed separately.
as is showing us cops tend to be the literal boot of the government

for those not in : what questions do you still have ? are their angles/content you want explored have not
or is it just mobilized every time the police feel challenged in any way ?
police out of 50 on the force.
thanks for the and for your coverage.
. typically all contained within a block or two. all happening within blocks of the shooting
were they returned etc etc
are media asking why swat teams are necessary ?
is anyone trying to go 1 by 1 through the police roster to find the shooter ?
have there been marches on the police station or city council ?
you are starting to grow on me. good coverage
i guess that means aggregates = sausage media.
my question what is their endgame ? or are they just deploying a full on occupation ?
i am surprised at how white protesters in nevada get away w/ pointing armed assault rifles at cops ...
this is why we need diversity in the newsroom people
weird how people might not trust the cops right now
which makes you more nervous out there protesters or pd ?
what is the racial history of this town ? how did the cops get this way ?
you are right.
how are the local politicians responding ? are people planing to run against them in next election ?
. one young man pulled a gun on cops last night. he was shot multiple times
typically blocking them from stretch where there are businesses ‚Äù
more reporting at how funding for the weaponry the police are using against citizen protesters. (1/2)
what do the people there want from the rest of us as they recover and work towards justice ?
who paid for all those weapons that tiny town is pd has ? who sold them ?
. these officer is name are the biggest remaining unanswered questions imo
how much media is there ? are they taking this seriously or chasing sensation ?
. mix of reasons. many do not trust local cops/have not come forward
have a story coming on this
yes media asked the police chief several times.
thanks one question. does she know what happened ? can you say ?
. easy i am a black man - the police
is legal support ores available to protesters ?
should this surprise anyone or even be frowned upon ?
sorry to say this but sometimes chants and marches are not enough remember chicago 1968 democratic convention
. typically blocking them from stretch where there are businesses
i have not seen an explanation for why michael brown was left in the street after the shooting.
does it like the situation is calming or becoming more tense ?
who is paying for this display of strength ' ? who is actually in control, city-wise ?
it seems like they have guns pointed at the people is this correct ?
any idea if the family will seek a second autopsy ?
should be repository of comparative data re : crime stats, evidence-based policing, profiling.
anything brown family would like outsiders to do in support ?
what is status of any budding community organizations being formed ? any occupy presence there either ?
why no media access ?
his grandmother said he was coming to visit her .... i heard. ??
this is thank you
at this yes to both
maybe u should be asking ‚Äú why would that piece of shit point a gun at police ‚Äú.
or ...
what is governor or state doing ?
why did not they shoot the white protesters at for also aiming guns at federal officials ?
what kind of organizing is happening on the ground ? are there factions or gradations of participation ?
i just do not understand the overkill with the guns etc w/ police to the protesters.
i do not know. maybe does. he is reporting live right now.
what plan is in place when anonymous releases the cops name ? protective custody ? armed detail ?
. cops in because investigators had to pause several times because they heard gunfire
grammar in this was terrible i am sorry)
have you seen any state legislators ? besides the one senator. anything from mo senators.
just want to say thank you for your coverage.
they would argue it worked then.
why is the reaction by authorities so different here than in ca for the incident ?
. correct. no way of knowing until we have name
how has a town that is 2/3rds black kept an overwhelmingly white power structure ?
yes they is my understanding
good but we are talking about different sets of cops/feds.
also a different skin pigmentation in the people protesting ...
probably answered elsewhere and i just missed it but what is response from local politicians ?
i am interested in pastors with mostly white flocks -- are they engaged, and with whom ?
he was with club today, where else ?
have the police said what would make them take their riot gear and go home ?
i am white and it is still an easy answer, the police
u talking about the pieces of shit at that had assault weapons aimed at cops ?
had not heard that. will inquire
they have at least four in custody btw
how spread out several blocks, etc) are these protests ?
who is coordinating the police effort ? who is making the decision to show so much force ?
is there any way to fire every policeman ?
really you really think that is what i meant ?
interview the rare black and ask what they feel like right now.
have you any statements from witnesses that claim they had video of shooting that had phones confiscated ?
they should probably be as well.
you are the least of the swine there
police talk about understanding ppm upset. do they understand their actions are not helping at all ?!
i am watching now
i would like to see an exploration of the historic disenfranchisement of the black majority in ferguson.
is there any talk of getting an autopsy done by a third party ?
are the police deploying an active denial system ?
i keep asking about the woman that was shot last night. any word on her ?
that is what i am saying
he could find them.
is there silence the governor of mo on this ? what at state-wide civic leaders ?
by whose orders who is in charge ?
has been interview by local or fbi
what is the governor ? what is happening in st louis proper ? great tweets btw
mo has open carry laws. do they apply to pop ?
i have not encountered them on the ground, but does not mean they are not here
why was never called to the scene ?
almost 3 days nothing since ? nothing on his website since.
where is the mo governor in all this ?
you bet now if everyone could be like us ....
i have mixed feelings about it.
nope. i was speaking about the other night. my time line speaks for itself.
what is the population in ? how big/small off a town ?
what is the mo governor doing ?
why are they wearing green came in an urban environment ?
a particularly interesting question given that st. louis is home to this thing
i did available on line ?
how much is this militarized police response costing the city/county/state ?
guns can not me did you mean ‚Äú loaded assault rifles ‚Äú ?
mostly if not all, going on ?
would like more info on federal law enforcement agencies that are helping police the protest.
breakdown of number of military vehicles/guns in county.
if he pulled a gun on the cops, that would happen.
i expected better of was.
as per interview i heard with this morning it was majority white until white flight left it majority
why have not the police finished interviewing witnesses after four days ?
some would argue that because of the intense police present. thoughts ?

dear pd after our towns murders we did not deploy swat respectfully a sandy hook dad and ex-cop .
sure they have called for mutual aid from other departments, if not. scary !
because unlike i follow protesters who have testified to being chased, shot at, and humiliated
or the national guard there are guard outposts near this town.
keep it silly goose.
again never said that. keep trying to spin it
dear pd after our towns murders we did not deploy swat respectfully a sandy hook dad and ex-cop.
it is call being prepared. i would have them be ready and not needed.
you did not have people rioting and looting either.
well respectfully you did not have riots and looters either.
. police presence in riot gear can be the catalyst to an escalation. it sends the wrong message
nice. keep it sweetie.
i am saying black people conducting peaceful protests = rioting to you and it is telling.
no when you assume that every protest has resulted in ' rioting ' you already do
thank you for speaking up.
and that is the injustice ...
was talking to him. not you.
only one who is blind to larger picture would say ‚Äú silly statement ‚Äú
. its overkill. its showing force when deescalation is their responsibility. thats not
in sandy unlike the cops were not covering up the murder.
do not know if there doing the same today
respectfully yes like as already mentioned there were not riots
mind you the and army gear happened from day one, before any item was looted.
completely different situation. no death threats and riots in sandy.
except the swat was deployed before the rioting. try again to justify it.
can not spin ' a racist, you already took the lead. enjoy oblivion. looks comfy
did sandy hook folks riot and threaten to kill officers ? no ? silly statement.
why question when for some racist reason, you never take into account that its not monolithic
their tactics are very
well respectfully you did not have riots and looters either. ‚Äù : üò¥üò¥üò¥üò¥
not that you because we deserve to be dehumanized. to ppm like you.
all i can say is it looks really bad
but your town is murders were not committed by the pd.
response in the first few hours, what happened to the serve part ?
your i can not be silent no more !
the police are dammed if they do dammed if they do not.
no one had to demand an investigation of the police in sandy hook.
respectfully yes like as already mentioned there were not riots ‚Äù / üò¥üò¥üò¥üò¥üò¥üò¥

if michael brown had shot and killed a police officer , would his identity be kept secret for his &

absolutely his name amp ; pic would be plastered everywhere !
i think he is the cop in ferguson. that is why they ai not releasing name.

congrats on your tweet !
his family were arrested in the weeks after. george zimmerman is alive.
he will be on the front page and the officer name would be in small bold letters
and his address would be listed.
do you believe that police would gather in protest and openly threaten the families lives ?

the fed showed their predisposition towards violence wed despite press presence. talk about mind sets.
why has no reporter interviewed the ' brown ' convenience store wouldesi ' owner in , robbed by michael brown
they did he said he did not steal anything
because they do not think he counts. he is not a real minority
poor guy probably does not want to be lynched if heaven forbid he calls the deceased a criminal.
because he fears for his life, can you blame him ?
because the scum making this incident into something it is not want to show brown as a church boy
was expressing love and gratitude to the store owner for letting him steal. peace love harmony
leave your racism in or better yet leave it at home.
take your crap back to your muslim homeland and it is not canada
they he said he had not been robbed.
i would bet he feels a little safer today with another criminal off the streets ! wow !
but also does not narrative of sweet gentle giant who the big bad police murdered

where does shooting unarmed men for walking in the street get you ?
how does that make you feel ?
calling out swat is not lessening tensions. it may escalate it

who is liberal what is a liberal ? why are you reducing this issue to party politics ?
reminds me of apartheid south africa 1960 ...

wait what is the first rule of gun safety ? ‚Äú do not talk about gun safety ‚Äú ?
i was just saying how they look eerily similar to the battle rattle that we would wear
never point a weapon at anything you do not intend to shoot. ‚Äú rule actually.
i‚Äôm watching this live stream ‚Ä¶ this is ridiculous man. they out here like an army unit.
treat every weapon as if it were loaded. ‚Äú
even in military riot control training we put away our rifles and train with batons and shields.

kind of what got them into this situation in the first place ...
a journalist was shot with wooden pellets. maybe the guns have those instead of bullets.
right so many gun safety ppm have told me that

what chief of police thomas jackson did was outrageous !

he is useless at this point.

not only outrageous but sheer incompetence so many questions, so little answers as the lies get debunked
what chief of police jackson did was outrageous !
' outrageous ' does not begin to describe it. makes no sense.
. police chief must resign now.
never jump to conclusions not knowing the full facts of the case
yet sadly expected. straight out of the giuliani playbook.
he just contradicted himself and totally just put that tape out to smear !
making a bad situation much worse.

wow even sillier. do you have a serious thought regarding significant events ?
you the bigger the belly the bigger the response.
hypothetical cause white people are not committing 90% of the crime in this country
can you give an example of that ever happening ?
that is no matter the circumstances. such hypocrisy.
i do not think the nra cares about anyone unless it is someone armed.
not if there were video of him robbing a store !!!
that is why they are pushing that crap about militarized police ' to hedge their bet.
and there be national coverage calling for the head and badge of said officer.
agreed. which is why we had to protest and the do had to get involved
i want to see more pictures of the fucked up businesses.
depends. it is happened disgustingly often here (albuquerque) but they were homeless/mentally ill
doubtful for sure. bet your butt they will be on the next one !

how much do you wanna bet that is true in more ways than we will ever really know ?
not at all. it was an important point.
why would you even re tweet a terrorist thought ?!!
yes ... takes one to know one, i guess
we could not even get a statement like that from our black president, obama.
what about your political prisoners ?
i rootlet what is especially from news makers, and this certainly qualifies.
both have reporters as prisoners. the one in ferguson will come out unscathed on tv
. so we agree. what is the point ?
is worse than germany !
us or have little regard for human rights. geo political and cultural factors override.
. for your i just did a rt of the big guy is tweet.
the government is famous for oppressing the world. now he suffers the consequences indoors ! .
you really do have a tremendous amount of chutzpah, given how your regime treats political dissidents.

exactly. both are the same shit
you are forgetting human rights of afghans and bahia is in iran. hypocrite.
i judge by the facts happening now on the ground in missouri !
. would you clarify what, exactly, are you saying ?
. i suppose you are right. what do they say ? it takes one to know one ?
do not fall for conspiracy theories.
i guess so as long as he acknowledges the same issue in his own yard
you are absolutely right. but this also applies to you.
. my tweet is a reply to the supreme leader is tweeted.
you mean anything has changed by his election ?
so says someone who wants to keep women oppressed. your opinion counts for naught in the west.
wish i could rt that.
seems like an ironic statement coming from him
surely the innocents killed in iraq would be a better example for both sides to ponder.
2009 brutal repression from iranian police and paramilitary operatives beat protesters after rigged elections
god illuminating follow our glorious supreme leader of the islamic republic of iran !
take a look at this list that indicates how frequent the same phenomenon has taken place
is the pot calling the kettle black. hypocrite much ?
you will have moral standing in the area of when you release the political prisoners held in even prison
rt the flag of is borne by enemies of human rights w/us leading them !
is a big with lots of contradictory realities. obama is elections are also meaningful.
are a country of intolerance and lies
. there is a kernel of truth to is tweeted because the us record is far from good.
what about killing scores of kurd, leftists, and political prisoners, and oppressing women ?

target him like he targeted mike brown & amp ; his entire community ?? aww boo- hui.
the court will make decision based on what the police/investigation tells them.
why will it put his family at risk when police said he did note wrong ?
what is more important w name is what actions have been taken against this he n riot gear ?
well then if there is no trial, the us is behind china when it comes to human rights
why act stupid by delaying the release of cop is name ? police chief is a joke
so u think i am looting, rioting and doing all that dumb stuff ?
because you people are already sending death threats and committing acts of violence and looting.
the police know who the cop is. why, right now is his name so important ? ?
who can request the court order ? anybody ?
why so he can be lynched ? this is stupid
not assuming anything here. just asking that we take it one step at a time.
the court will make a decision, 1st the name will be released before trial begins.
not sure the police know anything, the court will tell us
maybe u r one of them
good the person that he murdered is known, by now, to the world !!
do not tell a heartbroken community how to feel , what to say . try listening to them instead .
remember the buddy ranch vs government thing. all this ppm protesting with as they were patriots
use duct tape to mend up their dribbling heart. amateur field dressings are adorable.
no skittles , arizona iced tea , cops on scene . another black teen dead . whats their excuse now

this sounds very suspect. was he stopped for ? that is what i need to know.
my goal is to one day marry a corporation and have kids
i agree but i do not agree that deadly force was the answer
had to ... he was headed for a gun show.
cops need better and more training for this to stop.
they do have the training they just want to show their egos.
cops have ego and will double down over the stupidest, pettiest of non-criminal annoyances they are dealt
it is always hard to find the truth when lies are put out to bury it.
intimidation is just that scare tactics. sum of the most ‚Äú liberal ‚Äú states attempt to restrict
one thing certain teen was running very provocatively.
except when corporations become people.
well the just said we can after laws said we could not.
too quick to shoot an unarmed man
from what i have read it states not to share with cop. they can destroy it.
wherein a bunch of guys who served in iraq and afgh look at the cops and say : wtf ?
the question is always reasonable and appropriate force ‚Äú. and the cops are escalating that situation.
this look like good policing to you ?
this is what i am seeing in the news
read the goddamn coverage. people got gassed in their homes. read something besides the headlines.
we have fundamentally different relationships with authority. let is part pleasantly.
having the press around is one way to prevent police brutality. i will take the trade-off.
... i consider that ‚Äú escalation ‚Äú, to use your sarcasm quotes.
be and go our separate ways.
not even addressing people tear-gassed in their own yards.
no problem with cops being properly equipped. ‚Äú reasonably ‚Äú but handing out military grade hardware ...
been pleasant this whole time.
that is what i thanks. take care.
not denying there is some looting. always some assholes whenever trouble starts.
questions is fine once the area is calmed but not during a riot, public safety limiting casualties.
because it is not like there was no risk of that in this situation.
but you keep kind of skipping over the ‚Äú tear-gassing people in their own yards ‚Äú
not going to agree. farewell.
nobody burned down the neighborhood ‚Äú.

this is police harassment of reporters on private property. breathtakingly unconstitutional.
this has gotten way out of hand
i am hearing riot police sgt ; st police r saying it is not swat on the ground.

so they are state or local ... no legal right to question anyone.
this is illegal they need probable cause
it is not swat. appreciate your help but keep it real.
it has. and may get even worse.
congrats gutless execs who grounded their news choppers via a threat. you enabled this.

this is a pretty shitty way to frame bearing witness to grave injustices against the people of ferguson.

pathetic more like it ....
one photo was taken in a failed state whose people live under martial law . the other is from iraq

legally yes of he is.
legally it is. now stop tweeting your racist excuses at me, please.
i already blocked the dumb ass ...
racists need to believe was a criminal. they criminalize all young black men. he was unarmed.
like always blaming the victim and not holding the officer accountable for being unreasonable
reports say his hands were up and he was walking away when he was shot 10 times
you guess photo of war ? yes , you are right . this is a war between oppressor & amp
you said it before i could ..... true, true.
words are made weak when these actions speak ‚ô™
police force is to the protesters what israel is to : fascistic.
when police are militarized , they go to war with citizens .
putting on military uniforms in a heated situation is downright stupid, and only inflame the situation
keep ignoring systemic structures that keep some from ‚Äú competing. ‚Äú maybe a riot is just that.
happens naturally not by force ! u r equal to those u r able to compete with.
your social belongs in the last century. all lives are to be respected.
if you arrange people hierarchically by ‚Äú compete ‚Äú levels, they are not equal.
amp you believe the police ‚Äú attacked ‚Äú a peaceful crowd ? for the foolish üòî
the militaristic response makes sense if police view residents as being lesser, which is what residents claim.
i agree sadly a lot of wannabe military fake cops who love the show of force. idiots
dehumanizing people is unhealthy. people act according to their conditions. broken societies have desperate people.
when police are they go to war with citizens.
will not put up with racism on my thread. bye bye phipps.
criminals want to distract the issue for their benefit to gain more power.
they have a right to ‚Äú assemble ‚Äú not property endanger lives & amp ; order matters üòè
we appreciate you and understand the split second decision you have to make daily.
civil servants now equates to civil warriors. nothing like enforcing to blacks that they are the enemy.
understand what i said if you think a will fix anything you support üòî
first comes respect for law and police then you do not have to thugs.
the militarization of police makes meaningful sustained social/political protest nearly impossible = us fascism

you live in there have been spates of violence.
oh i thought you were being a shitty sarcastic man with the only tonight wet
they have been looting though. that is been documented by journalists

it‚Äôs like after when skin color was the only difference between a looter and a scavenger
not on which has been known to mislead millions from time to time
it is about the past 4 days of peaceful protests being reacted to and spoken about like riots
we need to wait for the investigation results ; then act if appropriate action does not take place
looting a burning a store among st other things not rioting tho ... hey its all good ...

everyone rioting is being extremely selfish and overshadowing the real issue which was the boy being killed.
right who has shot at whom ? the cops are pointing guns at unarmed ppm.
i hope that guys mom sees that pic of him and is ashamed.
okay. gotcha. sorry for misreading it. it happens in social media.
several witnesses say raised his hands, and said don‚Äôt shoot.
if the people would not of pulled guns and rioted then the cops would not be aiming back.
you mean the rubber bullet rounds that can be fired from the rifles ?
unarmed ppm pissed off because their community has been militarized, and they are being terrorized.
i do not think you are thinking this one through.
if i could get to missouri i would live feed the entire thing.
rt picture from earlier in the day, high powered rifles trained on protesters ‚Äù
cops are being militarized across the country.
exactly. unarmed protesters how do some people not see this as an injustice ?
agreed. i did hear that missouri state militia has boots on the ground to defend citizens.
the smug grin on that fuck‚Äôs face in the front center makes me want to punch shit
people are not unarmed and people are not just protesting.
i will try to set up a stream
you misunderstood. get the bad cops off the streets that target solely african americans.
that was funny as hell. omg
they are using rubber bullets -_________-
not enough of the media conversation re : has focused on the obviously militarized civilian police force.
are rubber bullet rounds in that specific weapon ?
effects of being shot with pepper ball gun
let me rephrase there is no justification for pointing a scoped ar-15 at protesters. ever.
maybe because people are rioting and trying to solve violence with violence.
they do have rubber bullet rounds for rifles so you might be right.
sorry wrong guy. i meant the guy with the gun. had my names mixed up.
if you do get out there be safe brother. remember your rights.
. 223 is considered a high powered cartridge ? just curious here.
civilians are are they not ? a rifle is a rifle, right ?

rayon black and unarmed
wow rt picture from earlier in the day, high powered rifles trained on protesters
it certainly is not that. look at the size difference. it is an actual scope.
pepper ball guns will look like paintball guns
i would not want a 223 pointed at me either
they do have rubber bullets for rifles chambered in. 223 (ar-15/m4)
if you do shoot me a link.
its easy to armchair quarterback when your life is not on the line.
almost want to go get some pics/footage since it is so close
right four witnesses have testified that he didn‚Äôt have a gun.
well at least you are acknowledging people are rioting.
guarantee those protesters pose more of a threat than supporters at a political rally.
maybe that is a bit different, no ? i imagine you can see the difference.
you would have to be hit in the temple.
looting is the least of the problem. killing unarmed people is the problem.

exactly. search how many unarmed black people have been killed by cops.
this country has always been plagued by racism, economic exploitation, inequality, and corruption.
how is being unarmed and protesting an act of violence ?
that such rifles have killed tens of thousands of lives, bellyaching about caliber is ludicrous.

plenty of cases of unarmed black men killed by cops. no other gun involved.
more than likely yes. they will use non-lethal rounds during riot control.

i am with you on that brother.
it causes harm and death though, that is why it was made. am i incorrect ?
looks like a lead on that map. sonic weapon. not making this sh*t up mt :
we understand the caliber if the situation. no pun intended.
if that rubber bullet hits the right spot yea ... big if though
you do realize that the community of has been militarized against unarmed ppm ?
i can confirm police deployed some kind of high pitched pulsing sonic crowd dispersal device last night

and how do you know they would not react that way ? you do not !
then quit acting like a bunch of hoodlums
it is about the preexisting conditions, and piggies killing a kid in cold blood.
many police are inferiority complex weak minded rednecks
concern trolling gets pretty a few is are pretty appropriate i would say
it is alluded versus elude - but he is an asshole troll anyway.
i think actually it is about both.
you are clearly an asshole on top of being a racist.
thanks i will def swing through sometime in the next couple days.
amp they do not even have all the facts yet
i would say they are doing a bang up job of undermining it themselves.
you will always have opportunists that will exploit conflict to benefit themselves ...
amazing wife policy over at right now.
or peacefully shop for guns in walmart it appears.
those are typos. who cares i do not. lmao
now you have resulted to insulting. lmao only person that needs to grow up is you
and you are assuming it is all black people. that is why this is a racial problem.
especially disenfranchised people who oppose authoritarians : pro palestinian, tibetan, n. koreans, ukraine
now fat bitch oh boy yea that really hurt. sorry it ignorant ass can not articulate
is not any killing a lawless killing ?
your son should die maybe then you will understand what it feels like to b targeted
so now you are a misogynistic racist asshole - thought you were done.
looting stopped a long time ago. the police are now breaking up peaceful protests w/tear gas explain
you do not even now you are racist. comedy. aw man lao
looting is a symptom of a different problem - lawlessness towards black people.
just like the bigot cop that killed that boy.
you went through all friends ? i think you missed a few buddies. look harder
this is the backward mindset towards victims of police brutality and why things are not changing
certain types use looting ‚Äú as opportunity to derail as if such can even negate grievances
a solution to the secondary problem but not the first.
2 different issues 1. murdered unarmed teen 2. underlying lawless racism behind killing.
in you do not think hispanics could get that angry ?
which is social injustice lawlessness against black males, and abuse of power
you are a child who clearly jerks off a lot. use your computer for something useful.
that is lie and u know it. that is not everywhere. quit generalizing
typical liberal. call someone a racist or bigot when they do not agree with you
maybe over in then :
sorry you can not admit it to yourself. it is clear to others. typical denial.
tell the redneck overzealous ego freaks to stop murdering people when they were not doing anything wrong
absolutely .... it is the police murdering a kid
my mentions. ignorant bigots who troll the internet to start twitter wars with
please do us a favor racist troll. do not embarrass the rest of us white people.
but you are the one who made the racist statement. prove these were all black incidents.
looting is not happening like you twitter people keep saying my aunt lives there its lies to justify
here is a simple solution for the problem
well then maybe you should stop talking like one. why mention the scanner calls then ?
those police shoot at will it seems
i guess we should not be allowed to peacefully protest.
my where i live.
the good old racist card.
listen to the police scanner. shots fired every 20minutes. reports of drivers. attempted breaking.
tell my friends i am racist. they will laugh at you. you are an idiot !
sounds like you are a fuck up then.
no only black young people ...
nice profile. you seem neutral.
oh you got jokes i am a computer not get cocky unless you want trouble
and these opportunists say nothing about people is struggle against a life of harassment
i am honestly just surprised you are in a mcdonald is.
that bigot will never admit. this is what they do. generalize. we are target practice

i am not sure what came of it though ....
police announce " your right to demonstrate is not being obstructed "
perhaps the police should stop murdering black people. then we can criticize folks for rioting.
dealing with awful racists is always terrible but i gotta say, the if stash helps.
we should but put it in perspective also
nope. people are responsible for their actions. also murder is a strong word ...
you just can not do it here. smh
remain in your homes. you are not being oppressed. all is well ‚Äú
which is true but their right to loot is ...
police announce your right to demonstrate is not being obstructed ‚Äú
this is ridiculous. you are conflating two wholly separate issues.
they are making telling is how it starts, sh
it really does. it shows disproportionate anger and fear.
can not keep fighting if you can not maintain your sanity at the same time.
. just go to your appointed free speech zone.
only your quest for open fires, free refreshments & amp ; household accessories.
it is a statistic but not a meaningful one.
that is some right there.
police announce your right to demonstrate is not being obstructed ‚Äú ‚Äù -
when there is an epidemic of murder-by-the-state, i will not criticize those who protest or even riot
in this i believe police action speaks much louder than their words.
i spit out my food !
i will criticize them for rioting and looting when the police stop murdering black people.
perhaps they should not have rioted and looted
please. young black males much more in danger from fellow young black males sadly
wait. how am i not right ? stats prove it
why are the police blocking the way ? are they afraid of protesters will loot again ?
amazing. rt police announce ‚Äú your right to demonstrate is not being obstructed ‚Äú
that is gotta be kinda hard to take coming from a sniper on an armored car.
what bullshit rt police announce ‚Äú your right to demonstrate is not being obstructed ‚Äú
and are you saying we should not hold the police to a higher standard ?
same government slaughtering millions of people in the world at the same time
violence by the state against citizens is especially pernicious and far more serious.
until the state stops murdering.
there is an enormous difference between being murdered by the state, and being murdered by a citizen.
even if you are right (which you are not) , that does not change a thing.
but most crimes against whites are committed by whites as well.
rt : the swat team has weapons drawn in at a protest in broad daylight with media attending

dear media : if michael brown is race is mentioned in a news report , so should officer darren wilson
how very generous of you to include me in your lack of knowledge. was murdered.
media does not know. better not to speculate what we do not know.
i wish i could rt this more than once
so that justifies shooting and killing him in broad daylight ?
pretty easy to make an educated guess
plenty of blacks called wilson too, facebook search would show
the police chief released it. he is a 25 year old white man.
totally means that we throw due process right out the window !
and what difference could that possibly make ?
did i say i justified the killing ? no. saying race is not the issue
how do you think everyone knows he is white ?
yea sounds like a black name too me ? i am just saying !!
twitter got the news of is murder out ! local stations here said nasa - until today.
so the cops shoot him and let his ‚Äú accomplice ‚Äú walk away uncharged ?

good lord. it is like the 60s all over again.
does not it auto credit him at the bottom ? apologies if not but seems to say via
good to will be more careful about putting user name in tweet
sure is a shame when police run up in churches and schools just to go after innocent children.
the dogs are unnecessary the human police decided to place them there !!
not on some
the information at this point in my opinion is of more importance, would you agree ?
is it true that the police did not have time to handcuff this one before they shot him ?
police department. 1963 birmingham called. they want their german shepherds back.
hate vs peace dogs can tell the difference

definitely food for thought thank you.
of course he does wt ?
i think you missed the point.
strike in it is 21.
how would they advance their agenda if they did not hide behind race baiting ?
sometimes that is all it takes.
racial biases when deciding what people to stop.
when are stopped by police at a disproportionately high rate, it is a race issue.

the militarized police is a symptom of the increasing militarization of our society, via the military/industrial complex.

a system of creating social fear. police = policy enforcers.
my opinion is cause and effect. this should not have happened if the young man was law-abiding.
no ... do not commit a crime is what in suggesting.
time to end police militarization now !
despite his being the cop is only option was to kill him.

it does not look shut down to me. it looks pretty open.
when all humans stop using a color to describe .....
that makes a lot of sense.
racial discrimination is still a dilemma in us . still ppl are unsecure for having dark skins . the way
thousands of gays marched in iran for rights would run out of space to hang them all.
fields medal is an iranian woman
of thousands and thousands of people. hamas has been worse than hitler.
the list goes on
the only terrorists are usa. .
; sadly true. we have much work to do here.
has tried. keeps firing rockets.
without you would be speaking german in catalonia right now !!!
bullshit. clearly the schools in catalonia are not very good.
you saved the world from fascism, stalingrad was the first defeat for nazis.
what is the last great spanish invention or contribution to the world ?
well so and have discrimination in common. in iran it is anti-arab anti-sunni
thanks your ayatollah we‚Äôll keep your comments in mind
tell it to all the children, women and innocent men killed by israel and usa.
. tell that to the bahia'i that you imprison for having a different faith
thanks proud of being said asshole by an american.
you would not have a country if it was not for america and britain. spain ?? hahaha
will be the tomb of fascism !!
the saved you. hahahaha
the only terrorists are you, usa. . ‚Äù ha !
i have found but your town is too far from here.
supplies and countless others to kill while they hide behind innocent.
i am a fascist really ? ok, and you are and asshole.
brought humanitarian supplies into palestinian territory. what did they get in return ? rockets on them.
ha. if there is one thing that unites the human race it is awfulness.
it would seem is an expert in such matters.
what is your opinion about cuba or israel and palestine ?.
much too complicated for 140 characters.
. remember when your political leader said there are no gay people in iran ?
and mind sanity in worst.
you have no idea what you are talking about. stop mutilating women !
the friend with has admitted to robbing the store with michael earlier that day.
you and the media spelled nothing but we see you for the cowardly killers you are.
hey the thug robbed a store attacked an employee and policeman deserved shot just like a jihad deserves
are you saving from fascism ?
call me is an insult for me.
. tho if we must compare gender discrimination top performer in league
that does not change the fact on the ground, dickhead !
did seriously say that the ussr defeated fascism ? that is like saying genghis khan invented democracy.
and you keep hanging gay men in the public square, you animal. go fuck yourself.
it is not racism ; it is profiling. ‚Äú
enjoy being one more puppet of your government and believing their liars.
why do whites run a mostly black town ? see what is fueling long-simmering tension in
fag. i am are god is.
think about what stories lead off ... drives certain groups to form opinions of other groups. very sad
every racist like yourself deserves to be murdered like michael brown was. eat shit.
ouch you are disgusting.
to the leg would have sufficed as far as stopping him.
put his hands and got shot 6 times.
why does hate police officers and white people ?
no they did not. and quit making ‚Äú hypothetical ‚Äú situations for something that is real life.
whites are more responsible. ‚Äù
but i am sure they voted for these white officials so this tweet and article is beyond stupid
cause the blacks are too dumb
who is running the headlines over at ? they are looking like fox news right now
i was not playing the educated card. i was merely demonstrating that your attempted wit was pointless.
article you felt so strongly about
because they do not know how to lead themselves without violence !
the local elections where city and county leaders are chosen.
the officer was trained enough to know not to shoot more than 3 times
did you read the article ?
law is for everyone and not just to be used for some.
why should any one race run a town can not we just get along
but a black person runs the country ?
damn did you forget what the british did to ur people ? internalized idiot.
exactly you are defending the area by claiming there uneducated or ignorant which still is no excuse
absolutely right facts r facts. when everything has been analyzed hopefully truth will bring change !
officers are not trained to discriminate based on race. break the law you get arrested.
uh cause the blacks are too dumb ‚Äù sh dumb racist bitch
you are right ... officers definitely are trained to target black people
if he was white you would blame the president and cry all over twitter ass clown.
how can your response to me prove a point about an area ? i am not from ferguson.
seeing you call someone a fag makes anything else you say unimportant. hateful and ignorant.
and u look like a man. yea in disgustingüòÇüòÇüòÇ
say that louder for the folks in the back !!!
i really do not care about making insinuations ... let is just wait for the autopsy results
powerful point wow we gotta elaborate on that one !
is racism still alive in america ?? read this thread and you will sadly get the answer.
defending would mean there are two sides ... so can you identify these two sides for me please ?
flip the two races around and everyone would be calling this tweet racist and offensive
sounds like a great plan !
that is an interesting statement to formulate from the article ... i would love to understand your thought process
and odd tire and wheel places which it almost is anyway.
did you read the article ? you clearly did not
i am a lover not a fighter ! we can leave her out if you want ?
no ma'am not at all just proving my point about the area that is all.
you just hit the nail directly on the head.
why is trying to fuel is a better question
they elect the mayor do not they ?
the poor people there probably do not have the education nor experience to run for congress
why do whites run a mostly black town ? see what is fueling long-simmering tension in
not important. a hayseed
that is not what the article stated
uh cause the blacks are too dumb ‚Äù
did you read the article ? that is not what it stated.
we need that autopsy report it will tell us how many bullets brown was struck with.
you are beating around the bush, ignoring my commentary & amp ; points and citing hearsay as factual
are u aware his mama is white. uh yea ok
i was never playing the ‚Äú race card ‚Äú. i am not even african american low
which election cycle are you referring to ?
what the fuck is wrong with you people ?
your response is very indicative that you were attempting to belittle my intelligence
i thought race did not matter
i understand the media especially cnn. but what people comment .... just awful.
defending i never made this a black or white thing when i tweeted you. you clearly have
white " anti-looting " high-horse riders listen up ! read & amp ; follow
keep blaming the victims. never the cops. always the victims.
considerably better than bigotry. ‚Äú
yep i am done when someone uses made up word whiteout no use having conversation with that
guess that was too hard of a question. thx buddy
oh mob behavior is always justified and righteous and looting is so productive to the cause.
you may want to drop the illogical, wrong. pc arguments.
what a case you make. ‚Äú
enlighten me on what i have missed ply
the will because they do not want to deal with the real issue of police abuse
and what i am getting at is there should be this type of outrage and time someone is killed
white riders listen up ! read & amp ; follow
amen brother. most courageous statement yet.
no problem brother. fucking airlift ? !
truly stupid argument. vacuous logic. and more importantly, morally wrong.
there was no looting last night. type facts asshole
are we in a loop ? asked and answered.
so how is officer not being held accountable
in the picture says i will not condemn them.
see the point but can not get behind the actions. business owners were not guilty of anything
never said police art accountable for their actions
they burnt down a convenience store/gas station.
your white guilt is so crippling its preventing you from thinking logically on matters of race.
and righteous rage has led to another dead and 1 shot in head so ...
we do not know if the shooting was justified yet but do know no homicide in chicago is justified
righteous rage is not destroying other people is stuff.
in chi plenty of murders no one is held accountable and the murder remains unsolved
what question you have not asked me a question.
yes homicide by definition is the unlawful killing of another in other words unjustified
but its just about only a few ppm taking advantage of just an oil opportunity. it is ok
i think maybe you need to learn to read a wee bit better.
nobody asked you to get behind anything but the outrage. support that first, foremost, loudest
yet this officer will face first an independent review of the incident and then criminal charges if found unjustified
the protests are fine but to condone looting is ridiculous
ply troll somebody else now, both of you.
u r so why is not there more outrage over the 500 murders in chicago
what a case you make.
. better righteous than whiteout. classic white supremacy :
tanks . military police . occupation . media blackout . no fly zone . in ... a suburb . this
check this out. trying to get some of the best news coverage in one place :
yeah. this is just crazy !
easy. there was no media blackout tuesday it was peaceful. leaders met with community in church.
it is that is a completely different kind of america than where i grew up
exactly like what is happened to the
lovely with some capsicum spray on them.
my column an execution in ferguson :
every branch of our government enables and encourages this, no politicians have objected on record.
more armored personnel carriers. but yes, scary.
how are those ' freedom fries ' tasting i wonder ?
it could be. it is not yet.
start electing people that realize this is a problem. military police should never be a thing
which are basically armored personnel carriers.
very true. it‚Äôs started slowly to happen since 9/11
another reason i became a libertarian.
there are no tanks. swat vehicles, yes, but no tanks.
it is not tho. that is the thing. it is every town.
my column an execution in ferguson :
same here. this is completely different from suburban chicago.
i agree the response and crackdown is getting worse, and has been since occupy.
going 2 war with americans
can you please cite the legislative source so i can look it up for myself. ty.
well innocent civilians are being rundown so come up with another plan
how should the police respond to the threat from ' local militia ' tea weirdos ?
do not believe every quote you see on the internet
trying to incite a war against americans in order to deflect from their execution of this child
this is some scary shit.
a terror child may be there. .
have gander at these tubes ! a molotov would a warm their ugly arises. ! fuck-wits.!
if they are wait on us to war w/each other. why the war machines for the
one dump truck would flatten em all.
no matter what we do , it will not be as bad as killing a kid and leaving him to

police department justice is not here right now ‚Äú
and they are being granted free will
that is probably a mistake. somebody should fix that.
it was derailed 2 hours ago when it was posted.
the is far more of a war zone than people care to acknowledge
i disagree block me dude
i was not talking about you ...
why on earth do you assume i do not know my own country ?
the warrior cop mentality has been carefully inculcated in the police to ready them for the tribulation ahead.
soldiers in a war zone can not even fire until fired upon. cops should be no different.
dead kids happen more and more from this inculcated mentality. it all must be opposed.
not relevant to this issue at all.
people who claim to be against big , intrusive government and for the constitution are cheerleading for the cops in
no just big spending ‚Äú
just do not want big intrusive gov not in their wallet. everywhere else is fine by them.
neither that either. liberals believe government has duties to its citizens to help, nothing to do
no because there is no liberal who claims to be for ‚Äú big government ‚Äú
conservatives are the biggest supporters of police brutality & amp ; extra judicial killings against blacks.
and not in the least surprising.
funny how that works.
can you substantiate that claim ?
could not the reverse be said ?
in their government is for protection and punishment. cops and military fill those roles.
police department justice is not here right now ‚Äú
the only small intrusive part of government they want is the part that involves them their civic responsibility
when an issue like this arises, everyone is suddenly an expert.

mike brown is death not problem or a problem-american problem. ‚Äù
you are right about that.
chief says officer darren wilson devastated . mike brown unavailable for comment about his feelings because dead .
too bad this is just people bitching about race ... not about a kid getting shot.
. devastated this has gone national.
mt chief says officer wilson devastated. mike brown unavailable for comment.
exactly a little too late to be ‚Äú devastated ‚Äú
or should have just arrested him if there was pc that a crime was committed
tell the dumb ass chief to sit his archie bunker looking ass down somewhere with that b.s. asap
congrats on your tweet !

st. louis county police tell me woman shot in the head and that a lt . on scene said she
which story is true ¬∑ 1m several confirmations of one fatality tonight. female shot in head.
i should clarify she was shot once in head, police tell me.
thank you. working from the newsroom tonight.
do you have a number so we can contact her ?
any updates on the victim ?
is she going to be ok ?
went on to mutter ‚Äú in spite of our best efforts ‚Äú under breath
yes from what i have seen on instagram, she is going to be fine
this is what i saw and a couple more before it
big sigh. so relieved to hear that confirmed from a reliable source ! stay safe out there !
did they tell you who she is !? i think that is my friend.
big relief .... let is hope so. & lt
you know i am right.
state senator asks the police chief if she is going to be gassed again .
do not suppose you have his reply ?
apparently she or another state senator has since been arrested.
senator maria naval. she was just arrested again for not moving.
i hope so. i will gas her !
what other options are there ?
state senator asks the police chief if she is going to be gassed again. ‚Äù crazy
i saw her tweet she was not arrested.
i have heard from multiple sources she was just arrested again for not moving for the tanks ?
uh what rt state senator asks the police chief if she is going to be gassed again.
state senator asks the police chief if she is going to be gassed again .‚Äù
has been corrected. she tweeted she was not arrested.
must really hate their state senators
‚Äú when will young people of color is lives matter when they are alive ? ‚Äù -
it causes some to think i wish it would cause all to think before its too late
when will young people of color is lives matter when they are alive ? ‚Äù -
when they are a after that no.
in this country seemingly never.
... the media shedding a light is powerful. it causes us to think twice about heated situations.
black bodies are no longer swinging from trees , they are laying on the streets .
black bodies are no longer swinging from trees, they are laying on the streets.
or in prisons on bullshit drug charges
these pictures coming out of with what looks like military equipment on american streets should sober everyone up ...
indeed it should. etc ........ same struggles, different lands.
looks like military surplus equipment from iraq or afghanistan. city cops do not wear beige camouflage uniforms.
you think the will sober up the rioting thugs, chuck ?
please show up pd to express intent to sue re. violation of 1st amend.
who protects u from the folks that are supposed to protect u ???
only holds a pilot and pilot/weapons officer. no joyriding.
that would be cute and stop the riot
just those drunk in the idea that racism is dead
perhaps you would like them to arrive in little red wagons ?
fascism is alive and well in america.
no kidding ... this is just unbelievable !
guess the injustice is not a cause for the buddy ranch militia to assemble for.
damn i never get to have fun ha
it is exactly that. surplus military goods and homeland security money give locals a quasi-military force.
well i hold pay ... sorry.
it not only scares it disgusts me.
we do cool shit too ... but i do not disagree ...
the were protesting peacefully at kent state. nice analogy.
state all over again.
the moves they can make are incredible
why are not white pundits and national elected white officials speaking out ?
and deliver too.
that thing can do amazing things
we would need a good co pilot. ?
where has big media been for the last four days ?
i have a problem with light mayonnaise. really wt
lets go for a ride in that fucker
all of that military but not a single dash cam, or any kind of camera.
it should sober everyone up but it will not. there is a lot of racism in this country
just crazy. all of it.
bad craziness . rt swat has weapons drawn in protest in broad daylight w/ media attending
the media watching means it is all for show and nothing is going to happen.
this shit is crazy. fucking tanks & amp ; snipers & amp ; grenades & amp ; shit
what country do we live in ?
there was no difference last night. the police denied ppm their 1st amend rights.
no i know. the police are putting the whole neighborhood in check
no wait. media is still there
i thought this was a picture from missouri, not afghanistan.
they kicked the media out about 15 minutes ago
good point supposedly better educated. some1 forgot 2 teach 1st amendment
should be on the other hands ' brutality against our own people !
armed state to suppress the right of people to peacefully assemble- treason.
only difference is the outfits but they all have their faces covered like cowards
holy shit. please continue to shine a bright light on this insanity.
you know picketing war heroes is constitutional but protesting the killing of a child is a problem.
bad craziness. rt swat has weapons drawn in protest in broad daylight w/ media attending
if this shit is getting to be normal, then it is time we had a new government.
reminds me of the supporters.
the bold and not so beautiful
it looks like the national guard to me. i mean what police officer wears came ?
" they say we destroying our own neighborhood . we do not own nothing out here . "
no and his crew burnt down the homes of the indigenous people that were already here.
but do not try to justify and looting !
i wish i could ask christopher columbus the same thing ... rt .... some looting and burning ?
i did not say that it happened over night.
i will definitely check into. peace, love, and light. shine on.
so what does that have to do with the quote ?
founding fathers took the long view to free themselves from european tyranny & amp ; conquest epic.
have you thought of starting a stream channel and running it at times throughout the day ?
the oppressor only knows one language. name a revolution without violence ....
your coverage has been amazing. thank you.
thats great that you have black friends ‚Äú
they say we destroying our own neighborhood. we do not own anything out here. ‚Äú
the were not perfect men but had a vision dr king would not have had a legacy without them
look it up or dont run. you have google.
i just wanted you to know ‚ò∫ love and respect all around
i feel you on that goddess ! let is continue to build and see what the future holds.
misguided concept. you have been reading too much history produced in the public schools
the issuance will pay to rebuild or relocate businesses. can not be rebuilt nor his families pain
complete tweet at me when you want to have a real conversation.
all bullshit. seeing as though the letter ‚Äú j ‚Äú was not invented until after the 1600 is
and when doing what did they do ?
already done ... i am canadian.
of blacks can not be racist ! you keep thinking that ! goodbye !
that us good to hear. many negative things are attributed to the founding fathers that are not true
it is. sad.
and then how can you know what happened unless you were right there ?
you celebrate thanksgiving day and columbus day or do you protest it ?
i agree with you completely.
exactly. great reporting thank you. may the ancestors guide all the rebellion.
that was not the real jesus. i am sorry you were deceived.
if you can muster the courage read dines de sousa is america-imagine the world without her
and us history is not world history üòë get a grip
your anger is an insult to good people and will ultimately be the destruction of your soul
founding fathers risk was first step forward to transform america and influence changes in europe
it took another 60 years to give women the right to vote.
absolutely not. i question the things that are taught in public schools as well.
and why would anyone protest those days ?
the same that was used to enslave my ancestors ? fuck you
in he is feminine. try again !
dying is not winning. or we would all be nonexistent.
they love there. do they not even know what neighborhood means ? ripferguson
i do not know where you got that from, but his name in hebrew is joshua.
i did not think it was. what is your point ?
i appreciate your history lesson for sure. i will keep that in mind.
incredible. i am cape. rt already done ... i am canadian.
you are saying they burnt down george washington is house !?!?
whats is white privilege cracker ass telling oppressed people that they should continue to take oppression
milk fans. what you want is evil and self destructive.
black people have the right to be angry !!!
did not happen over night it took almost a century to end slavery in which a war was fought
j is a y and y is an. try again
i fear i may have integrated my people into a burning house ‚Äú -mlk
hannity throws a softball to police chief
absolute hypocrite the scary thing is that his audience eats it up !
annuity makes me want t0 puke ~
like o orally and much of the rep party i.e. cruz, mcconnell, bother
heavily involved scam scandal ripping of veterans. he is scum to top all scum
his attitude towards buddy versus mike brown prove his racism.
lucky you. he literally makes me puke.
tell us how you really feel. lol
do you know which ? is it the koch supported cia ?
he is a typical jerk
just another two faced
that is seditious .... and out of line ... even for a pig like annuity !
is a racist idiot.
annuity is nothing more than racist scum.
got burned twice shy not willing to get completely behind chief jackson who lost investigation !
the should investigate for inciting a riot
the white inferiority complex redneck is already like that. would say anything to make a buck
is highly influential racist scum.
this is the one. does annual fund raising 4 them with bands, stars and huge rally
yes this is racist to the bone
ranch embarrassed the police state.
police state was thoroughly embarrassed. and lost. naturally they released some nonsense propaganda.
i have had a few of those in my life too.
annuity is nothing more than racist scum.
teenager shot dead. his trial. the court of public opinion
ron johnson says he would have liked to been consulted by chief jackson about today is release of info .
you think are a bunch of baboons !!!! not coordinating with cut johnson
hey look ! a must box at a presser, finally !
talk to bill at the pd about this
the officer all the way to the left looks like robin williams !
of course no one likes being used sh
michael brown was supposed to start classes at vatterott college on monday . instead gunned down in street by police
i am a young angry person sh i will be writing this later ! hoping to spread awareness !
if you have anymore personal details about him, id love to share it
police militarization on display in
we are not far from living in a country like v for vendetta
it would only take a. 50 cal. to knock those out.
if u wonder why r increasingly : police now ‚Äú trained ‚Äú
not sure. apparently we do not have a good count last i heard.
would not even need that. they are big sitting ducks. intimidation is their main value.
. prepping for the real war against the middle class when the revolution against marginalization because of globalization starts
this is not what i want my country to be like ‚Äú : police militarization on display in ‚Äù
so that is where all those kids on milk cartons go.
they are all into pedophilia too.
if you have toys ‚Äú, you will play with them.
police militarization on display in. makes me feel safe to know they are capable.
with a dual citizen & amp ; jesuit educated catholic what do you expect ?
rt : picture from earlier in the day , high powered rifles trained on protesters
rt picture from earlier in the day, high powered rifles trained on protesters ‚Äù
those are cops looks like an invading army. this country has become too fucking militarized.
you see the cop grinning ? wtf ?
. rt picture from earlier in the day, high powered rifles trained on protesters
rt picture from earlier in the day, high powered rifles trained on protesters ‚Äú
yep those are cops. supposedly ' our ' cops but that is never been felt that way
that is crazy like we are actually in a war zone.
all white boys ready to take out them black ones with no disregard.
there is still no justification stated for to be shot to death .
if your life was in danger, what would you do ?
there is still no justification stated for to be shot to death.
and you were clearly dropped on your head you retarded, shallow-gene pool, mouth-breathing neanderthal asshole
i would lie for my kid too
do not include me in your racist bullshit.
if he went for the officers gun ... that is a justification for being shot.
no he is a dispatcher with a pt job at the dollar store. fuck off
suspect in convenience store robbery carries death penalty sentence. good to know.
fuck off. that is not what i said.
his was interviewed yesterday. ‚Äú guuuuurl ‚Äú you crazy !
come one fact or your a liar !!!!!!!!
find them yourself. is parents were interviewed yesterday
theres no justification for protests either as nobody has any idea what happened yet
worst press conference ever. let someone with intelligence and balls tell us what really happened.
will y'all be releasing wilson information ?
after the whistleblower revealed what was happening , he was summarily harassed , got drug tests , car taken &
they have gotten away so much. (typo)
..... y'all make sure this not be forgotten, everybody get your boogie yoga on !
they have gotten with too much and still calling people animals. smh
protests continue at the qt
fascism on the rise.
as they should wish i where there as well
the fault there lies with the police, for not releasing information still no info in the shooting
i am pleased with the way the state police officers are handling the process
are people in confirming that the man in the surveillance photo is mike brown ?
the deceased was not dressed in the same clothing as the person in those images.
apparently it was what he was about, as witnesses confirmed he stole the box of cigars
follow justice report bro.
. rt protests continue at the qt ‚Äù
the man in the video did not have on sneakers.
protests continue at the qt ‚Äù !!!!
innocent until proven guilty. yes it applies to police officers as well.
this is probably the greatest thing i have seen so far
powerful image. wanted to share.
this is probably the greatest thing i have seen so far
this is probably the greatest thing i have seen so far ‚Äù
yes i absolutely it technically can mean bad or good that is y i said that
you need to redefine greatest.
love it thanks for the share and it is true !
do you understand the definition of pandering ? bless your heart.
this is probably the greatest thing i have seen so far pose looks familiar low
this is probably the greatest thing i have seen so far ‚Äù
pander. awesome penmanship.
so cute. they are innocent in all of this. they deserve a better, peaceful future !
bullshit. no one of any race feels safe or respected by the police.
wait till one of those friends rape and rob you and get u hooked on crack
the protestors in are not armed . why is swat out there like they are raiding a weapons depot ?
i am going to assume you are high and fucking ' with me
oh. okay. ask la shop owners about that one.
i leave the house. i stay out of situations that could cause me harm
yeah you do. in private ? yeah. you do.
fuck how it sounds. fuck what the govt deems an adult. an 18yo is a kid.
just tear gas and pepper spray. no violence whatsoever.
yes even the first night. or did you think the dogs were there to keep things calm ?
have you responded with any ? other than race baiting ? thought you blocked me ?
good for those cleaning up. shouldnt have to clean up after an unhinged black youth
reflection on black people here.
is he implying that ppm had to take things from stores to survive that we are uncivilized ?
so they responded before he said anything ? bye
i thought your point was looting is inherently not peaceful ... which would be an accurate point ...
what threat 2nd amendment. it‚Äôs as basic a right as assembly. just like clive buddy.
black response a conclusion on human behavior based on two natural disasters ?!
just say fuck twitter format tho
explain to me what heavily armed men in body armor need dogs for to be safe.
yes it is. and so are you.
no your willingness to hand wave police brutality is the problem. i hope you learn the hard way
are you implying the tsunami did not ?
actually it is relevant. taking what someone has worked for is an assault against their person.
i am going to keep a good thought for you to reap everything you have sewn.
and there it is. you can not dress up ignorance and bigotry for too long.
an is not a kid.
sure i still would not make looting violence
they knew it was cold-blooded murder !
then feel free to follow & amp ; stay the fuck out of my mentions. bye !
how is an not a kid ? please enlighten us.
lets not forget there were riots in the streets just a few days ago
not a fan of card games sour puss. take care.
theory cops seek bloody confrontation w/ blacks to retroactively justify their own illegal behavior.
pretty sure is a racist troll who will ignore everything that does not fit his bias.
i am the actual not kidwhateverthefuck. i do not know this kid.
bye. sounds to me your half the problem.
then at what point does a kid become an adult ? when you want to define it ?
because they have been looting and rioting like a bunch of animals. idiot.
swat needs to be prepared and armed based on protocol. real crimes happened just two days ago
riots instigated by the violence of militarized police, but keep that smiley face
i was not aware that ‚Äú kid ‚Äú was a legally defined term.
if you have not noticed, white america hates black people !
trolls look for visceral responses. if i was trolling, i would say i did pretty well.
i stopped. now blocking as i go
the cops have been the aggressors all along rt because they have turned violent. and could again
its appealing to emotion. harming a child ‚Äú is worse than ‚Äú harming an adult ‚Äú
my guess is dude works for fbi if he is calling for race war
an is legally an adult. that is the legal threshold. maturity does not matter
so you do not leave your house ? wake up. it could be you, next time.
yup i am sure you will. good day.
. he has 9 followers. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
against their person not everything bad is violence.
was not an armed protester shot last night ? . that is why they are there.
this whole situation has really had my block fingers active. thanks for keeping up the good fight !
who said that ever ' assume '.
it but ms. peaceful race batter sees it otherwise ... sans any examples.
like the riot in 2004 after the red so/yankees game. no tanks. no swat. nothing.
pretty sure amp are just trolling bigots. block & amp ; move bb
nor does the possibility of crime justify such a response.
yes it is. esp when unarmed
just stop the false between violence and property damage it does not justify the militarization of cops
why you talking to the witless bigots ?
not sympathetic to riots at any age. its not appropriate. protests are
so you would not mind me sticking you up for cash ?
the cops shot a kid
actually that story has changed repeatedly. no way to know if he was armed or not
not every one. but enough to turn now into a war zone.
reporting this ignorant fool for spam. obviously trolling.
not anyone else is fault you did not learn that before now
also the of followers i have is irrelevant. ganging up on me is not civil anyway
i am asking you you responded.
what about lighting someones store on fire ? does that become violence ?
wow sh you sir are part of the problem.
the race card does not work on me sweet
you will excuse us for not having more sympathy for a cop who shot an unarmed man.
i promise amp have no interest in facts.
can you give me some examples of peaceful looting ?
i think that is a tangent and a shitty argument.
the dogs and the weapons are there as a precaution. pre means before.
so you like police brutality when it comes to sparky goat ?
yeah except he was the one who got killed. and he was, in fact, innocent.
like they clean up after unhinged white ones ?
alright it is question time for racist whitey. your move.
do not waste our time with these pro police brutality trolls. he has 8 followers anyway.
he has been calling for the killing of white babies since right after the shooting.
not all blacks are uncivilized chanel. just too many of them are to ignore.
it makes it sound less heinous. im talking about how it sounds.
i did not say that.
ask shopkeepers in about it
looks like the worst full contact game of othello.
because he is one year over the legal age it is less heinous ???
the police dogs were there before they picked to body of the ground.
you would be more sympathetic to riots etc if he was one year younger ?
wrong. i have better things to do than indulge your fantasies.
yes sometimes they do. that is inexcusable. does not happen as often/same scale though.
but has more interesting tweets than you
because they have turned violent. and could again
the police do not consist of a few bad apples , the institution itself is rotten to the core .
many think hung representative police dept is not. they become indoctrinated 2b 1st, not black/brown
not as long as individuals are considered suspects because of being black.
main roads blocked off . found a back way . i am back at the qt in
had 3,500 followers before the ferguson riots erupted.
that is real be real safe reporting this# my city is failing me
be safe they can not be happy with your reporting. i am praying
where is the elected leaders ???
i would block off roads too for 4 cent gas !
why not the mayor is house ?
rt : state senator asks the police chief if she is going to be gassed again .
damn them some pig of ' fat
there is a town that is a no-fly-zone with a media blackout right in the middle of our country .
what are they doing that they do not want us to see ?
i can be there armed !
compete let us have our american ‚Äú fall ‚Äú like the arabic spring
do not want media televising.
that is exactly where we are headed.
this country is being taken from us all its near the end of true freedom.
why the no fly zone ?
i think this is a watershed moment. people will wait for investigation.
thoughts are with . we need 2 collectively take a stand against senseless violence that confronts our youth .
thoughts are with. we need 2 collectively take a stand against senseless violence that confronts our youth.
we also need to take a stand against people who think it is ok to rob others.
black people die 2 deaths : 1 ) by public execution & amp ; 2 ) an assassination of their
are you talking about ? stop for lotus 2016.
both speak to the need for real anti-racist struggles against these type of injustices
... that means you are out of decent arguments, i win.
congrats on your tweet !
this guy shot 11 people , including a congresswoman and a judge . he was apprehended alive .
point is white people get to live. black people are shot dead in the street.
what is your implication here ? every1 arrested for murder or only teens killed for allegedly stealing piggies
this guy shot 11 including a congresswoman and a judge. he was apprehended alive.
dude looks kinda though.
there‚Äôs plenty more where that came from, many of ‚Äò em even cop-shooters :
bring your religion into this. ?
yeah call 9-1-1 it is felony jaywalking in the first degree. what jerk offs pd
is that the best you can do ?
congrats on your tweet !
oh now that you mention it .....
different different different circumstances ...
that does not make any sense at all. please leave your ignorance else where dear sir
the point is that why is this 30 y/o man arrested and an unarmed teenager is shot ?
can provide you with any evidence you need bro.
because the mainstream press is giving him exactly what he wanted, .
is that why he is smiling ? smh
so what does that prove, anyway ?
you are right. this is the first unarmed black man killed by cops recently. idiot.
there is no doubt some truth in that. is the solution to rant and riot ?
every single day people are murdered by power hungry fascists with badges. what would you do ?
congrats on your tweet !
wow powerful when you put it that way.
that was actually my first thought.
would not shut i do not have a gun '
i am happy living elsewhere ... but i do not like blanket condemnations of anyone ... incl police.
i think the point is why shoot an unarmed teen and not an armed adult ?
this engineered a dispersal of a sit-in that resulted in 1,000 deaths, and was elected president
ironically they likely saved his life.
it is probably he complied when confronted by police
but jaywalking .... well that is another matter !!
based on a culture of police racism all over the usa is what i base it on.
alive because he was attacked by victims as he failed to reload, read -
mt this guy shot 11 ppm, incl a congresswoman + judge. he was apprehended alive.
i will support the good ones when they start turning the bad ones in.
if your your all right. the old song instill true.
is there any evidence besides this tweet ?
awareness of over policing of minorities/african americans does not benefit from misrepresentation.
as he should have been.
looks like a family member of rick scott is !
you can say that based on one example ?
vs see the difference ?
explain how he was a thug ?
there is lawlessness in but not on the side of the protesters !
does not love or
people that wear suits murder more people than people that wear saggy pants. perhaps you are thug.
i the black community needs more organization, less rioting to have a better public case.
the man in the on the right has a melanin deficiency and possibly a mental disorder.
. and even after not one ‚Äú patriot ‚Äú sniper arrested from
police must take all breaches of the law seriously. nothing should be ignored.
there are too many laws and the people do not make them.
vs see the difference ? ‚Äù the right picture is why framers have us !
it is a police state were living in.
absolutely true. if they were not so uncivilized, they would make police have to shoot them.
the kid was with collaborating witnesses.
they have brought the dogs out in
of course they did ... they shoot then they bring out dogs for protesters. . what b s
kill an unarmed kid amp ; bring out the dogs. smdh.
wow they have brought the dogs out in ‚Äù
they have brought the dogs out in ‚Äù ‚Äù
they have brought the dogs out in ‚Äù
they have brought the dogs out in
they have brought the dogs out in ‚Äù
wow they have brought the dogs out in ‚Äù
they have brought the dogs out in ‚Äù
revisiting history huh : they have brought the dogs out in ‚Äù
crowd circa : they have brought the dogs out in ‚Äù
where are you in the crowd ?
taking it back to the 60s ‚Äú : they have brought the dogs out in ‚Äù
they have brought the dogs out in ‚Äù
bad comparison. circa 1950 no social media or media access. people would already be getting pounded.
they live for moments like this, can not wait to confront the angry black mob
police in have not been wearing identification : via / fire the pd .
why not what are they hiding ???
another wrong to add to ever increasing list !
they all need to go.
the feds must investigate this police force for multiple abuses of power, rights
... extract savings from former expenditures in order to pay back old debt. just a psychotic thought.
just like the police in 1968. history repeats itself.
can you read they were asked to remove them for their security because of internet vigilantes.
it is helicopters flying in . how a drive by happen and y'all ai not spot it ??! with west
wait .... i thought there was a faa warning. üòí
how did a drive by occur and only one person wounded ?
ferguson police have dogs and shotguns . the unarmed crowd is raising their hands .
guns kill people.
wish some people had dogs also like pits
yes. and then they will kill lighter- and lighter-skinned folk until there is nobody left.
police have dogs and shotguns. the unarmed crowd is raising their hands.
horrible. those brave people.
somehow , whenever there‚Äôs a police brutality case , the victim is reaching for someone‚Äôs gun . it‚Äôs weird ,
no you are thinking of white people who shoot up innocent people in public spaces.
that is the script. oh and ‚Äú there was a struggle ‚Äú.
do not forget altercation ‚Äú
i do not know the link, friend showed me
yeah cut it is there and every one knows a police officer has one
which makes the police would be more violent if someone is taking their weapon ...
not even white. why would u assume in white. must be that ignorance shinning through.
police over react and exaggerate the situation
usually only white people make egg accounts to troll people.
i am defending this guy ! outraged that something like this happened
no need to start shitting on whites. jeez, let is stick to shitting on these cops
all in is it was a security camera and it was fox news if that helps at all
yes it is total bullshit !!!
u must got a metro pcs huh ? u look like u got a metro pcs.
also a video of brown assaulting officer
what are they going to say next he shot himself
do not feel hopeless if you are far from . organize your block or your hood . unite tenants ,
are any black bloc in ? they are really needed there.

the black ones are not much fact often worse. like women.
yes describe people protesting police officer killing michael brown as " mob " . then , edit , " crowd
we really need to stand as a people against corrupt gov not ... all us.
what is the difference between a mob and a peaceful demonstration ? apparently -- skin color.
i would rt your statement daily if i could. how quickly some (ppm) forget
that is why we the people must stand together.
they shot an unarmed child in the street without consequence
the were described as a militia defending their constitutional rights. skin color. they had guns.
white people at the buddy ranch pointed guns at cops were called patriots. blacks protest = mob.
and yet another instance of police being too quick to snuff out the life of an african-american.
mob begun they are if they are the t-party, it is a crowd.
that is how they view us when more than 1 gets together.
2 of bands patriots killed two cops. i have not heard much about that !

well we may use it all when isis comes to town. but not before that !!!!!!!!!!!!..
this image is unreal . cops in dressed & amp ; armed for war , confronting a lone protestor
absolutely. making that connection is crucial. can not support or ignore this behavior elsewhere
militarized cops acting like they are in kandahar or falujah make the situation worse
yeah but the video of this exact picture shows the same thing just a different angle
because us police quelling a riot are equal to totalitarian government in china ?
world always did and will always fight empires. eurohumans are disappearing
there is more than one angle. he was walking alone.
and leaving legacies of vile hunger to coerce and attempt to subject others to miseries
cops acting like a military force makes me think of china, not the us.
my point precisely. i only think modern military equipment is scarier looking.
are they really that scared of black folks ??? this is crazy !
the square tank man ‚Äú had a lot going on around him too.
so what you have snipers on bridges aimed at officers ! who shot @ or killed them ?

you do not ask ‚Äú with loaded guns and tear gas.
word is that state sen. maria chappelle-nadal is one of the members of the peaceful protest.

watch it lives. it is insane. it is a peaceful protest, not an invasion.
all that but not a single camera, dash cam, etc.

the purpose of law enforcement is to protect the community and serve the law
police department justice is not here right now ‚Äú via
this is who is next sadly
ford of lost angels answers your question.
every black person should drill this in their heads : we are in jim crow 2 . 0 .. and
i but nobody cares about a white guy getting killed buy a black cop
it is on fake radial right/white supremacist sites
he is walking around yes
waste of time. this dude is most liking trolling.
and at all costs ‚Äú does not apply to twitter debates
so u can not point to anything else ? correct
i care when any innocent person gets killed. for you to care, they must be black
so name calling on twitter is your response sir ?
so it needs to be a specific method of killing ?
no he is not he is informing us in what is going on so we can brainstorm
how do you know this cop will go unpunished ?
how many gun shots does it take to claim self defense ??
no but what you can do is hopefully understand why some folks feel the way they do
my point is. labeling entire groups benefits neither of us gentlemen. handle stuff case-by-case.
if we stop talking about cancer, will it go away ?
okay well i will not.
no the motivation is that these cops go unpunished for killing unarmed black teens
shockingly it is true amp ; surprisingly he is free, but he was fired from pd
case by case basis. how many times have you had to defend yourself with a gun ?
i guess it never occurred to any of us that shoplifting was punishable by death.
no it is not ?
just waking up i see tweets from so i know the suspected white supremacist are getting it started early
garner was killed on camera and the cop had not been punished yet
is the disproportionate amount of black on white crime ‚Äú profiling ‚Äú ?
of crime scene yellow tape ? clips of news reports ? thought so. foh
he better fucking sweat it because he is what is wrong with this country, in the racial sense
stop using the terms black ‚Äú and ‚Äú white ‚Äú and you will see the issue
so what should be the punishment for all these white cops beating up and killing unarmed black people ?
can you fucking listen to what i am trying to get across to you ?
too fucking bad dude when your people decide to judge us all we have the right to retaliate
the cops are we should not point that out ?
killing someone in self defense is not a crime. that seems to be what happened here.
does not make a difference to me you still look like them
you missed the part about being profiled for it which can cost your life kinda like jordan davis
you said with a choke hold ‚Äú
you think a few actions of cops would change stats that contain thousands in the sample/study ?
and that means what exactly ?
now it is time to block dave because he is using the white supremacist tactic of wasting time.
please my tweet and answer the question
there is not enough room for it here. would you like an email ?
43 followers huh you guys are getting lazy with your trolling accounts
profiling is real it is not a fucking game dude
so you were there on that day and you saw exactly what happened ?
what areas in the country are black people totally safe from suspected white supremacist cops then ?
the story is fucking true. do you want me to find another one for you ?
stop sitting by allowing white cops to murder unarmed black people and then get back to me
the was started by nathan redford forrest. stop trolling
i only posted that to disprove the idea that there are no corrupt black cops.
oh yea by who ?
it is the only case that is exposed by media
i can name at least 7 innocent unarmed black people killed or harmed by cops in the last month
the witnesses r telling a different story. at first the police said the boy was stealing.
stop saying white cops. you are fucking offending white people, if that even matters anymore
i swear to you i am not
i am not responsible for the actions of others or unrelated people and neither are you.
and he mobs of hundreds of black teens go unpunished for robbing stores and beating innocents.
this is an article of what happened in ferguson, mo
and largely they do yes. they will arrest 1 or 2 of 50
everybody who breaks the law should be punished.
what should be done about law enforcement committing murder against unarmed black people ?
but no one said that. so you are arguing against something u made up
think what you want you know damn well how this system is set up
they are battling each other to fight over who controls the non- white people
why do supposedly upstanding police enable this behavior if they are really that much better ?
so are u saying blacks are more prone to crime ?
you are the one saying it is not about race, correct ?
please post a story about a black cop killing a white person with a choke hold
you are trying to piece together a truly intellectual argument and it is falling apart
can you provide proof of that sir
enlighten us what areas in the country are black people totally safe from suspected white supremacist cops then
what are you talking about ?
mobs of hundreds ‚Äú of black teens going unpunished for robbing stores
so you are saying that all these black people deserved to be killed, correct ?
the author of that book has had his bs debunked already
the article you put up were using the terms ‚Äú black ‚Äú and ‚Äú white ‚Äú
there u go. i was waiting on the trolling to begin. good day
he was off duty when the altercation happened. he was not in uniform
maybe you should stop race baiting and throwing unfounded accusations around. wait for the facts.
read the book. it might enlighten you.
single most asinine tweet i have read all year. you sir are a race baiting jackass.
does not defeat my argument either way
corrupt cops of all races are dangerous. we need to all acknowledge that before getting anywhere
not as evil as white cops executing unarmed black teens
are you really incapable of understanding what the fuck i am trying to say ?
shit is fake
we got a tweeter thug ! lol i can not take you serious dude.
no he is not he is being honest. tariq you streaming tonight ?
he is telling you a very bias and racial standpoint
the same way you stop the 93% of whites killed by other whites.
and you are using the terms black and white
exactly this guy actually thinks we all have equal rights
and do those blacks go unpunished ?
yes many people are saying that shoplifting story was made up
dude it is a true story ink why ur saying it is fake
when black people get caught committing crimes against white people they usually go to paid leave 4 them
and turned down a debate with mr washed
you just want an excuse to bash your neighbor. god help you
troll acct no. you are sidestepping honest debate.
once people called the stores and the owners denied calling the police, they are changing their story.
you need to stop acting like you do not know how this system is structured. keep it real
the same for anybody that commits murder as proven in a court of law.
you should not use that as a method of motivation to get black people sensitive about the topic
so there are no such things as black cops in your mind ?
it is sad how incredible true this is.
i am asking a legit ??
one little fact keeps getting dismissed ! young man is dead. dead !
much to say about ‚Ä¶ but can‚Äôt be bothered w/a fallen 2 star general ‚Ä¶ the pres . is an
the general obviously was a republican !
highest ranking officer in over forty years ... nasa. obama is disdain for the military is overwhelming.
and not one of them went to generals funeral. white against black never covered.

is an absentee president !
we need to impeach him and at the ballot box ‚Ä¶ one vote at a time !
beyond disturbing president 0 did not even have flags.
a pressing golf date was more important to that awful example of dishonor and cowardice.
agree and this mob gets 24/7 coverage now for one week officer will never get justice
he does not never has, never will. it is time to and.
did not so much as mention this 34 yr. soldiers death to the american public.
my husband is buried 200 yeses from not a word on any media or damn shame continues

did these cops go to israel for training like nypd ?
let us translate that for you : ag holder has instructed attorneys to do nothing in case.
hey u guys have the night off ! we are onto tonight. get back with u tomorrow
they better bring their guns .... things are not looking good right now.
of course great opportunity to gin up the base.
i hope he is stressing an investigation to the senseless killing of a 17yr. old child !
about time higher government paid attention. cops are out of control.
not only brownout crawford and garner and any others i may have missed
that is a good sign.
and how are some of y'all so quick to believe the same police dept . that threw tear gas at
the pd charged a black man with destruction of property for getting blood on a uniform !
they shot tear gas at what was obviously a news crew, set up to report.
right shooting kids over a cigar ? really ?! wth is really going on in amerikkka ?!
and refuse to identify refuse to answer questions about how many shots etc.
most sane people will wait for the investigation which you will promptly call a cover up.
i would not trust the pd telling me the weather report.

he was profiled and murdered. there are numerous eye witness accounts on twitter about the murder of
it has not become so overt i thought i might point out the obvious.
the cop was responding to two young men walking while black. the punishment is immediate execution.
minorities are getting it from all sides, syn, stop and frisk, and shoot on sight.
they will not interview him because he ran like a coward after his actions got his friend killed.
i guess now stands for under steady assault blacks, latinos, women, poor, mc.
coming from we still do not know why he was killed. hard to make a call ?
the has always had two uniforms. police during the day, white sheets at night.
homeland security has given $34 billion to local police to militarize in the name of ' counterterrorism . '
the times of looking to others for relief has passed for me. i trust only the people.
you misunderstood because the police are not countering terrorism ... they are terrorizing unarmed citizens
that money would have been useful for adapting areas to climate change which is the greater threat.

thanks for your tweets the past few days. you have helped immensely.
you will find historical perspective in this book from. a similar case in tea neck, 1991 :
your tweets tonight have been amazing. pure prose in a time of chaos.
one of the stranger elements of covering all this is seeing major demonstrations expressed in a suburban context.
just like temporary autonomous zone is him bey on watch list ?
is a small municipality. businesses, schools, church is- no separate space for demonstrations.
. and how many public spaces are even in that area to begin with, i wonder.
we do not really have pedestrian squares in the us, only an l'il in nyc
acts of agents provocateur are treason.
every and any attempt by govt to limit legitimate, non-violent protest in public spaces is unconstitutional.
now everybody is a bit wired up because a woman almost tried to drive through the police line.
please write something long on that.
pretty good reason to burn down a quiktrip imo

the constitution of the united states does not state that citizens can only peacefully assemble in the daytime .
you know that there can be limits put on rights in certain situations, give it a rest
a curfew may be necessary .... imo
actually it and is in the 1st amendment,
not all of it. which is a shame because the peaceful protesters have been overshadowed.
destroying property and looting are not ' peaceful '
the constitution of the united states does not state that citizens can only peacefully assemble in the daytime.
black people do not have constitutional rights
since your preaching constitution. how do you feel about the right i bear arms ?
has it been peaceful tho ??
no but it should say michael skolnik needs a better haircut.

they on the shit fa who sh
can anyone identify the weapon this officer is protecting and serving with ?
where are the folks ... guess this is not their kind of overreach
not relevant to the situation at all.
so black people being upset over murdering then lying about it is being ridiculous ?
answer those given half billion $$ worth of military weapons by this congress !
you are dreaming if you think this white cop that executed is not a
doing their job and protecting themselves and others but i dunno in not american
the swat team has weapons drawn in at a protest in broad daylight with media attending ‚Äù
not at but good luck dude.
u have got to be kidding ... this is insane
except that no one except the police have been using weapons.
do you even live here ?
. so much for being ‚Äú peace officers ‚Äú. this has to be stopped.
i hope there is a good guy w/a gun in case this asshole starts murdering ppm
but they do not have the right to riot and loot which some have proven they will.
that is fascism. study amp ;
so who are the police holding the guns ? militia ?
assembling peacefully are you fucking blind ? they are tearing shit apart, burning down buildings and stealing
if that is what you call being called out. whatever boosts your self esteem.
riots have been known to involve shootings stabbings etc all over but like i said protest & gt ;
why how many cops shot a year ? so delusional.
it just seems like a higher government body needs to step in
i want for my km that fits trijicon mr is 150usd-ish. 200 seems right.
i was hoping for something more specific than that.
black people do not lose their constitutional right to assemble just b/c white people are uncomfortable
there also is anarchists on the texas border pointing rifles at skinny little kids.
anything not or accessories costs more.
i do otherwise i would not have sent out the message.
is it police or military ? think about what is happening folks ! this could be your neighborhood.

why do you think everyone who voices their opinion on this situation is racist ? i completely agree with

tough to say for sure but it looks like an ar-15 covered in being. see gun rule -
was right there and saw the whole thing. why take 4 days to talk to dorian huh ?
your swat guys should be out of public line of sight and left to protest but there for
unfortunately not. it is just insane.
the fuck man you are one desperate person. must be a cop.
bet some people have them though but i dunno havana american riots to the police before
is this weapon pointed at unarmed americans protesting under the constitution of these united states ?
this is just escalating things ! you do not aim sniper rifles at demonstrators !!
it is if you did you would know there is a difference
different how maybe transparency ? maybe outside investigations ? hmm a little common sense.
why mt swat team has weapons drawn in at a protest in broad daylight with media attending
typical brain dead sheep response. go kiss your masters feet.
he is just waiting for his cue.
then that proves the area is a bad area. no wonder cops are on edge.
he‚Äôs got a box. that‚Äôs not fair.
go spread your racist hate somewhere else.
pretty sure that is a vortex scope, prob this one
backup if it did turn nasty as they look like they expect it to
you obviously have terrible comprehension and common sense if you do not know what i mean. amazing.
guessing if they are rioting and armed over a death they will go for the police probably guys
assembling peacefully my ass they are being ridiculous and everything that they are doing is wrong !
maybe so. compare it to this
more cops seeking to more black people and violate their freedom of assembly rights.
do you really think it makes a difference ? get a grip.
anyone else remembers state ?
hand guard is from rifles and is somewhere in the range of $200.
industries us palm. good reviews but can not buy mr the price of the rifle.
when did not serve and protect ' become not suppress and terrorize ' ? seriously, wt man ?

literally the most boldly obvious lie i have ever read.

counterproductive if you are in denial. we need an entirely new private police. simple.

apartheid has a different form in the us. but the police brutality statistics tell the truth.
its time to retaliate by spilling their blood. fuck the police !
how do you suggest we do that ?

its all in our heads.
consider it done i have had enough of this watching good men and women die.
they are not horrified. they are just playing a role.

demographics r like the make up of classrooms in many of our communities.
right on i hope this world changes soon
full of time racists police officers. cotton plantation masters ' descendants & amp ; butts fucking pigs
looting is not respectful no matter what happened beforehand.
we need more love and compassion in this world, bottom line, we are in it together üíú
always the victim .... sad.
lets not forget that they stated that they do not even have plans to interview anyone
i am with not the color of their skin ... who applied for those jobs too ???
what is the racial breakdown of the looters ?
what investigation all witnesses to the event have not been interviewed.
calling people names and what not will not bring anyone back, investigation is still ongoing
very hard to believe thank you very much for this information. i am so sorry for eeuu
really that is a productive and mature response ... sh
you just do not get it ! that is the problem
i am with you michelle.
... the makeup of the police dept. here is a breakdown : ‚Äú
you are a disservice to the conversation, stop yelling.
i do not get what. that blacks would rather see blacks killed by blacks ?
and that name calling does not help ....
well that is another problem then, still name calling is completely unproductive is it not ?
point i was trying to make is long lost .... ty
that i hope you will still stand w/me cause i will stand with you !
i guess would install just anyone black to equal the look instead of quality ??
getting used to kill people because of their color is not respectful at all especially unarmed teenager.

liberal whites from new did not do that or allow it.
well apply for a job with the police
no one makes anyone believes anything, they choose to.
know his intentions or what is in his soul.
you believe that
oh i know and i know the people of ferguson can remove them .... just vote.
i think we have been mostly agreeing this whole time.
the problem is we are living under a two party dictator ship
saw interview a woman who said black voters were disenfranchised. nonsense, they just did not bother
people has nothing to do with liberals doing anything.
with king so denying their impact is a lie.
the real question is how the ferguson police will act when everyone is gone

you talking about the citizens or cops or both ?
thank you liberal white folks. however could we po ' blacks survive without you ? /sarcasm off

per : as of this am , witness dorian johnson has still not spoken to st. louis county pd despite
numerous attempts by whom ? dorian or county pd ?
think he means made the attempts, not the police.
pd. clarified in tweets
his attorney is a decades long family friend.
i mean by reporters.
that is not what he tweeted.
he should go to the prosecutor instead
maybe so but they are also trying to do an investigation with the feds that takes time right ?
if the fed investigation concludes that the cop should not go to jail then what else can b done
family attorney rump said yesterday that johnson planned to give written statement to police
at this point i would hope higher authorities would totally take over case. this is not right
in because has appeared on basically every single hsbc show in last 24-hours
they are too busy trying to get the city under control first i am guessing
found their witness pretty easily ...
and as is atty says they will meet w/fbi + county prosecutor today
him attempting or the police attempting ?
numerous attempts from the pd to get him in or vice verse ?
no. his attorneys have said multiple times they contacted the police and they declined.
... like at this point i think they are just making of game of saying bullshit.
did you read any of the followup tweets ?
was not he is interviewed right out of the station ?
extremely poorly worded. need to clarify
after went natl w/ his story. i personally arranged that media into.
. i can tell you first hand this is not true. his attorneys called. were rebuffed.
but why would the police lie ? oh, never mind.
they did not. in rebuffed his attorneys. i met w/ johnson + his lawyers.
right police say they made the attempts, not that johnson made the attempts +
no legal standing to do so. can make informal request, but too late now.
.... they were told his statement was not needed at this time
since people are asking police say that they have made numerous attempts to reach johnson
please dont try to buy me out , money or anything . my story is for justice .
keep it man. thank you for staying strong.
super sketch. i hope the authority takes your testimony seriously.
look at lurking.
block him dude. he‚Äôs just looking for a come up. seems like a spammer as well.
that girl who got her phone confiscated needs to tell the press tho
that is so dirty and yo for holding true ! thank you, brother. ‚úä

it is messed up when cops can shoot unarmed black teen yet white people can walk around target with ar-15
stating facts is not string up hate.
if the residents of had ar-15s, the media would have labeled them cop killers.
you make good points. can not really do much against a map used in war overseas ...
you are out of your mind. that is a recipe for a total disaster.
has any of the local media confirm he was unarmed ? assuming you are near there that is.
treated him like a damn animal
can i use this tweet in my article ?
mt if residents at were armed w/ar-15s situation would have gone different. why 2nd and exist
so what are black communities supposed to do in these situations ? sit back and be terrorized ?
u bet i am what ? complete thoughts help out in communication.
humans can not seem to be trusted to govern themselves ...
humans are animals though ... they were acting like animals as well. primates to be precise.
stirring up hate does not help you know. a senseless killing is tragic enough.
right .... and this is why we need mental health care in this country.
they brought riot gear and riot trucks. they wanted there to be an altercation.

good i got about halfway through and it is making me sick ...
agreed. hopefully the protests last night changed some hearts and minds.
first coast reporting violent protests in last night.
not only in lots of work to be done in these united states ...

whenever you want to justify shooting an unarmed person you always say they reached for your gun . george zimmerman
a trial baby steps baby steps. they do not think a crime was committed.
the police are already doing that
this is y all cops should have body cams, dash cams, and interior car cams
an intelligent person will always do their best to know their opponent.
he has exposed is naked racism
this is called the armed white mans defense ‚Äú
next they will produce a witness whose story changes 3 times before it coalesces for trial
is election popped is giant zit of racism. now the puss is oozing out.
do not care what they think but i do observe their tactics.
and do not think they do not know it
they have declared war on us and freaking holder should step in
i can not believe this man. running away while reaching for the gun. lying ass motherfuckers.
this shit is backlash from a black president
i fear cops more than criminals
let is not care what they think. that is always been part of the problem
and he reached for my gun ‚Äú is all you need especially when the victim is black.
there has to be video like crazy. nothing from witness phones yet ?
it looks like an execution from this vantage. it really does.
dude. that is too gross even for me, but true ...
if there was only a technology that allowed police interactions to be recorded ....
or they will discredit a witness because he or she does not speak ‚Äú proper ‚Äú english
this shit is so blatant they shooting brothers while being filmed
you are an intellectual causes the other guys trouble.
not that the truth.

seriously you know that would not be the case. stop it ! have a productive day.
man wit the chips ‚Äú in this iconic photo from has been identified. ‚Äù
not true whatsoever. that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs quoted. it‚Äôs a self-referential.
looks like we have an internet legend on our hands
if he wants to remain anonymous let him. no need to cheapen the reason he was there !
the shooting shows that being passive leads 2 more injustice . if a black cop shot an unarmed white teen
that man was off duty. he had no business shooting him.
seriously when you see enough of these stories you start seeing the patterns and see the narrative
and about of white murders are by whites as well. what is your point ?
hearing that he was shoplifting. is that true ? what are the exact details ?
4 riots in 4 different years in michigan university
in the crowd. police were laughing, one said ‚Äú that would not be my son. ‚Äú
fine. a video of student riots along with anti police brutality chants.
where is the bed wenches talking about being scared of the police ?
you are a troll so blocked. deuces
cup riots 2011. primarily white people
blacks folks out there need to grab their guns and let heads roll in the steers
what are the numbers on black cops shooting white teens though ?
enough black kids get killed in the street and it just might happen.
there was every color in that.
are you also going to claim the hockey riots were not overwhelmingly white also ?
when you say well known ‚Äú you are talking about ones allowed to be on white controlled media
this is what we need to be doing only then will this stop and not a second sooner
are you saying soccer is popular in america ? it is not. other countries yes.
first of all why do you act like al sharp ton represents all of us ?
that teen did something to be shot at. camera will tell.
there is no way that teen was complying with the cops for that to happen.
why have not the police released it to quell the riot ?
my point is deal with where they come from. instead of riots.
ugh. thank you for the info. know that my thoughts are on.
so the penalty for shoplifting is death now. they need to stop the madness.
real fucking talk but the question is to riot, property damage, only go after the police ?
they feel in danger lmao
that is what you want to see. get the facts before making conclusions.
do not know full details. i was not there when he was shot
now we will see what this teen did before making unsupported accusations.
why do not you check the eyewitness account at : 55
has heard about hidden colors ? could they maybe show some of it at ?
we are done. you are just racist. cause he was unarmed.
i was out there a little while ago. it was crazy !
zero. because they know that the dominant society would not be passive about it
i am done. i do not socialize with racist on either side of the spectrum.
at least when we riot is over important issues like police brutality, poverty and racism.
seriously we are telling about white people. they just do not exist in america you know.
and check what this witness tells the reporter :
i have watched your films i am skeptical that even if we pooled economics for more (cont)
had whites tearing places up.
second let is look at the deaths by police
also here are white surfers from california rioting and destroying property last year
what are people doing out there now ?
... of unarmed person. you still have no examples
i do not recall complaining about white deaths.
until a white man went out after 50 or more whites were attacked for his revenge.
are you seriously going to claim white ppm never riot and destroy property ?
well single digits get killed by cops ; so, rioting the wrong place.
riots in 2014 after march madness
all cars have cameras on them. the truth is out there.
so you have no proof and are just trolling for attention. duly noted.
also when have unarmed white teens been shot by black cops when not committing a crime ?
you are done cut you have not had any your facts straight in our reactions
none of that was done here
they are over there talking about ‚Äú he should not have been stealing. ‚Äú
this was an hour or so ago. not sure what is happening now.
you do know over if all african american deaths are done by other african americans ?
now that there is video showing it is almost all-white riot what is your excuse now ?
more interested in the car camera.
white people riot over losing soccer games. look up soccer hooligans genius.
and as in the grant case the shooting of unarmed black youth on camera apparently does not matter
news is only interested in what happens to black ppm. and i am not even joking.

is not that the truth ! it is shocking how militarized police forces have become !
who is voluntarily raising his hands in the area. that is what i do not fucking expect.
never said troops. our troops do not have gear that good.
is that a serious comment ?
but you will not correct it, because you are all popularity and pushing the right buttons.
there are between 11,000 and 16,000 pc forces in baghdad, this is a stupid sentiment.
not civil servants. my statement.
private military companies do not represent a ‚Äú militarized force ‚Äú on behalf of the us ?
and every person allowing their little buttons to be pushed by you should be ashamed.
you win. our police are acting like blithering idiots.
regarding that particular the police did not use their guns, did they ?
pretty sure any time a gun is pointed at someone it is being used.

you must live in a real shit hole cause i do not believe anything the police w/o verification
bullshit. everyone makes mistakes. it is how you handle em.
you make zero sense and sound dumb making such comments
you are basically saying if 1 media outlet reports something then every media outlet is responsible
you know its impossible for police to lie or do anything wrong in general
you can not be the truth seekers when you report false information, period.

immediately corrected by multiple major anon accounts. no one complaining about account suspension.

you know what my point is.
you do know there are hundreds of thousands of muslims inside the police forces and military ?

have had surveillance on these guys after shootings
the hostages will be killed. act no french special forces, you cannot negotiate with these crazies
. so would a news blackout not be advisable ?
so stop broadcasting live feeds from the scene so the gunman will not know.
this is not surprising but agree with others media black out needs to happen
storm both at the same time then or cut the aerial so he can not watch tell ?
repeating the gunshots is better than a blackout ! !
think maybe a news black out would be advisable for safety reasons
police need to jam all communications media to gunmen at both sites.

exactly. will fear be the response to this tragedy ?
i am no expert. i am just pointing out the majority of recent violence comes from islam
no one should feel entitled to special treatment. especially when they think irrational violence is acceptable.
i think you will find that the uk that you live in attacked extremists to protect itself
indeed. only the ' phobia ' is unjustified, as it implies irrationality.
the took off the terrorist list. of course the west does not fuck care.

it has everything to do with islam
do not live in silence. try to show others it is ok to speak your mind
fuck political correctness. violent ideologies have violent consequences. it is time we acknowledged the truth.
ask the of how well that worked out. if u can find any
western governments are to the end.
you have massively contradicted yourself there
the west needs to wake up and understand islam is at war with us
i forgot are not illegally invading countries and using drones to kill innocent people
is justified when of terrorist attacks are carried out by people promoting islam

what a statement dear cherry. any idea about this question ?
is the issue or the liberals who have allowed this islam protection in the west ?
i saw that what a few weeks ago ? cause a genocidal terror group can b reasoned with
i am sure it has nothing to today with islam.
this has nothing to do with christianity. christians go to church on sundays and are peaceful.
so it is a reasonable assumption to suggest islamic extremists are behind this

almost all world conflicts current involve muslims - guess it is coincidence
you know nothing. the moderate muslims are those that deviate from the original.
i know nothing please read the talmud, then come back with comments plus
mad. i absolutely condemn the attack and those who did it.
then they are no true believers. why can not u grasp this ???
absolutely class absolute mental awareness appreciate ur reply üé©
sorry i thought i replied to yayshamsaldeen. must have hit the wrong one.
this one has. it is called islam and the terrorists are conducting their attacks in islams name.
limiting mass immigration by backward fascistic peasants with fantasy friends, who hate freedom.
read it states violence against jews and others is fine.
it seems you are defending the terrorist attack, and condemning us. typical.
not i was talking to yayshamsaldeen
i will look at it when i am home. pls answer my question about israel and phosphor
.... not to kill innocent in any circumstances.
because its not the truth. every person who commits terrorist activities, are no true believer.
no that is not true. quran says, respect jews and christians
fuck off you foul shit.
at this moment do you think anyone gives a shit
here here but anywhere other than britain.
no it does not. just shows we are as barbaric as they are
such a stupid comment can only come from someone stupid and ignorant.
can u please stop talking ? appearantly, u know nothing about islam.
ya that will fix the problem
go back to my 1st comment and u will understand my main point (1)
president condemns ‚Äú barbaric act ‚Äú : gun attack kills 11 ‚Äù
now u r escaping from offending muslims to condemning the attack.
here you go. more in duran if you want to enlighten yourself.
well what exactly do you propose ? diplomacy, harsh language, a slap on the wrist ?
no of course it does not even if muslims did the shooting offs
you are an idiot go away. we¬¥ve had enough of muslim violence and murder
dear are attacking muslim countries too, just a simple example.
thank you for insulting me. again, read the talmud !!!!
terrorism has a religion. we know what it is.
at this moment i doubt anyone could give a shit about offending muslims
whether they are or jew.
i pray to god they do not blame muslims. because terrorism has no religion !!!
and u are just one of those many people who are condemning all muslims. generalising its called.
president condemns barbaric act ‚Äú after attack kills 11 rt
is signing it is death wish by importing muslims by the thousands every year.
so terrorism did not exist outside of islam ?
keep your head buried and you might just be allowed to keep it.
you are an apologist for barbarians. & lt ; here is why
then explain to me why the world always blame muslims when something wrong happens
u have to know that even muslim countries r attacked (and were attacked) by terrorists !
find the people that did this, then execute them in front of their families
the attack suspects have reportedly fired shots while robbing a petrol station
little shits are just using religion to go around murdering innocent people because they are uneducated no-good thugs
best to shot to kill the muslim shits !!
deluded thieving folks just need to read the right books and stay off drugs !
i hope they catch these cowards alive so they can face justice.
the attack suspects have reportedly fired shots while robbing a petrol station
it appears amp ; louise have rocket launchers, empties !
why have these worthless pricks not been taken out yet ?
do not think they were trying to change the world, revenge was there motive
french official says attack on paris weekly was with kalachnikov automatic rifles and rocket launcher . unprecedented .
by unprecedented of course you mean ‚Äú unprecedented since the last atrocity a couple of weeks ago ‚Äù
let is forget the massacre in paris & amp ; gaza, not
they thought the crocodile would eat them last.
but as expected. why can so few sees what is coming our way ?
apparently you do not know that is packed with refugees that were expelled by
lets other people live peaceably in israel. arabs & amp ; muslims do not.
just like does not want jordanian refugees on west bank
the number of yes. the principle, no.
but that is nothing compared to is carnage in which killed more than 2000
refugees such violent pigs their own countrymen in egypt, jordan, syria will not take back
they did not appreciate the security council vote ?
if stops brutalizing amp ; imprisoning gaza, rockets stop-there, i fixed it for you
are such violent pigs that egypt is building massive barrier to keep out.
pretty fathomable actually. it is a peaceful thing to do
just buy it what they show u. okey ?
wonder who could be responsible for that ?
if stops attacking violence stops. that simple. listen to son of haas founder
unfathomable. mt attack on paris weekly was w/ kalashnikov automatic rifles and rocket launcher. unprecedented.

good or bad ppm. their behavior not necessary that related to their religion.

show some respect for these innocent journalists and policemen who were killed ! !
and your point being that all featured in the pictures you have posted are brainwashed. sickening really
. that does not hide the fact people use religion as an excuse to kill
its pointless explaining to atheists that there is religion, its like saying we were born from nowhere.
i think that is what i said. who is the idiot ?
we evolved. get over it !

no point in preaching to me, an atheist ! ban every religion i say !
in the name of god ?
of course it is where in my past comments did i say it was ? gobshite !
interpret it as a horrific act of unjustifiable violence by individuals. not an entire religion.

i want to listen to it again, but can not watch it again
need someone who speaks both languages fluently to give their opinion
or quite they could speak russian clearly too
this video captured some clear vocals - it sure sounds like it.
yes but good to publicize both points of view then at least one can be discounted
there are also known nationals who joined isis from tatarstan and other muslim regions
. was right after all.
not but there are chechen and dagestani, - and reports that most cruel
surely authorities are analyzing audio
think we need someone who speaks both languages fluently
true. but let is keep a fair amount of skepticism meanwhile
and we confirmed. thats language. and without accent
do you speak to make a proper assessment ?
it is possible they switched to french- but i heard russian
i think we are on the same page ... important to post it ...
probably best not to its horrific they need hanging by their balls for a week
the link i tweeted from fm originally tweeted by is an excerpt so not too graphic
you are right just trying to raise awareness important point
heard all their top brass is chechen ?
do you guys speak to make a proper assessment ?
i had to stop the feed after seeing the policeman
yes i could not bear to see that .... just horrible.
did you listen to it ?
it no accent whatsoever. they were russian.
there is like a regiment size of a company there i think. top brass - no way
i am certainly no language expert, but it was quite audible to me
i can not watch it or listen again. but, to me, it was very clear.
very beginning after first i think - can not bring myself to watch again
maybe will give the and there may be no more attacks on france.
pt appears to speak ‚Äú - language expert obviously needed to confirm
the policeman right there. horrid
update - french television channel ' france 2 ' are reporting that the hostage held by suspected gunmen is male

this was a well-planned attack : the gunmen hit in the middle of the weekly conference , with all staff
smells like an inside to me anyways.
some one on the staff leaked something start with any muslim employees
not triggered by the artistic release of ‚Äú the interview ? ‚Äú
paris-based journalist says the attack on charlie hebdo is hq involved men armed with " rocket propelled grenades "
moderate need to protest and not allow the radical elements to create chaos and mayhem
looks like every charlie hebdo cartoonist has been killed : 1 . charb - was on al-qaeda is hit list
give them an they blow up a mile.
background sees the deep state.
then they must recruit some more cartoonists and continue publishing cartoons.
gunmen at is paris hq shouted they had " avenged the prophet " , reports say
avenged you idiots. all you have done is make more people hate muslims.
it is a very small number of extremists damaging the reputation of the entire religion
why must i be careful what i say ?
sensible is the word you should have used
of course they do mental illness, poverty and religious fanaticism are the perfect combination for hatred.
they live to and brainwash ....
it was sarcasm. there is no army. i was making a point to this deluded racist.
what about extremists in like the westboro baptist church ? shall i judge christians based on that ?
these people are no doubt.
feel free to come and gibe me a knock ...... just make sure you have health insurance
very sad situation however be careful what you say sad pathetic racist.
the number is not as small as you think ..... do not be fooled
i am on your side here buddy, hahn
not because of because it is a peaceful religion, but because of these individuals twisted beliefs
if your beliefs are where is the billion-strong muslim army destroying everything in it is path ?
why should you come and kill me ? who says you should do that ?
sigh it seems you actually know nothing,
is not a race you brainless idiot
but scholar who has a degree in all things religious
they may loathe gays but at least they do not hang them. your point is invalid
who are nice the french or the terrorists ?
you are fucking bastard he only far 1 part from the conversation now i would love to kill
i really do not care if i offend you ........ in fact i am glad i offend you
defense vs going to another country in another time and killing possibly innocent people is different.
defending themselves seems pretty rational and justified, would not you agree ?
i strongly condemn this terrorist attack as a turkish muslim. terrorists cannot represent islam
i thought it was obvious you are being offensive you dumb fuck.
the difference is do not actually do it
bro as we we are taught not to hurt anybody in any way unless they hurt us
yes it seems so ....... plenty of evidence to back you up on that
exactly because they realism that it is stupid
deluded sensible and you are calling him brainless ?
you are not answering my replies that disprove yours and now you are changing the topic to stoning ?
and i am pretty sure it was not god who said that it was man.
you must travel your own road ....................
the media certainly help with that too.
you know you can just read half the words i said
only he without sin can cast the first stone.
oh sorry mate. i thought you were talking to me
where did you hear this ? the all-so-reliable media ? thought so
okay what word should i have used ?

1st person killed by terrorists was a french muslim cop , rip ahmed merabet . bigotry is always wrong !
bigotry is a state of mind where a person strongly and unfairly dislikes other people, ideas
if there was a god it must be powerful enough to destroy the evil
i thought i did on multiple occasions and who is getting angry ?
no pres did not support it, one of a handful that voted against.
yes that is true for some humans.
the idea of god might prevail though. seems like it is part of our dna
bigotry meaning the ppm starting like kill all muslims, and muslim scum, etc.
a hash tag that says kill all muslims is vile !
i do understand your point and have trouble with it sometimes myself
you can push your stupid mantra somewhere else, he did not support islam fascism idiot
i am for that fully support that ! they need to be eviscerated.
i mean i understand what he is saying just don‚Äôt know how my tweet started it.
would have been the most monotonous & amp ; abominable place in the universe
the instinct to kill is embedded in human genes as one of d most prominent characteristics
you pick the one you had to go around many others like this
how is that a mantra ? or wrong ?
also think you are forgetting a little thing like the invasion of kuwait
um my husband fought in that war, bosnia camp ; iraq 2nd time in 2003-2004
maybe ... maybe not. i know i believe in a creator who put us on planet earth.
also like a decade of slaughter between iranians and \iraqis with millions killed - then they turned on kuwait
d day foisting of false info of god into d clean minds is stopped god shall die forever
how can the evil of oligarchy be viewed much differently. we the people need to stand with bern
our understanding of god is less than a bird is understanding of the moon.
murder in d name of border disputes is not a criminal act is another human hypocrisy
brainwashed pole behave like savages hindutuva in india is d terrorist outfit to watch
of course but is history or the present at issue ?
humans cannot stop being violent any more than they can respect life on this planet
yes i do not doubt it,
i tweeted what you are tweeting, that the terrorists killed muslims.
do not worry about the vile tweets. disregard them. maybe they are not so vile ?
yes and there is a place and time for it, not on heels of their atrocity please
... humans ... mankind is the deadliest creature god has put on earth.
no not even close.
take a look at this article : highlights what you and isis misunderstood
god is imaginary and has long served it is purpose.
1 of my tweets mentioned support of peaceful muslims, against a 100 against attacks camp ; supporting victims
i should wait until some rwnj kills a bunch of innocent muslims ? or sikhs they misidentify !
humans are possibly the worst thing to happen to this planet
to those murdered by fascists ?
there is always hope ... pandora is box. good in the end always wins ... always.
your making a historical i am giving you examples
or maybe god is like a scientist creating all kinds of life forms
bigotry is always wrong ‚Äú wt
why has become home to such as ? read here :
. if we stay more people will die.
you should not impose your belief on others through violence and discrimination
and people find the truth. at some point religion will not exist.
how did you get that from is tweeted ?
all religion is so all types of behavior should be expected
maybe he put us here cause other planets were dying. or maybe ...
fictional victims has never killed innocent muslims. oh wait ...
. consider this and what is truly vile in life.
could not have said it betters ! that tweet is now on my
making a game of killing animals is sickening. how can such evil be a form of recreation ?
can you not fight you actually disagree with ? we freaking agree !
of course. are you even reading my replies ?
there was no euphemism. i seriously have no idea what you are talking about.
not within the next 50,000 years i am afraid, evolution does not work that fast
for absolutely not doubt about that
if god put humans on earth then he is a fucking idiot
there is no harm in you believing in anything that you have been foisted with however(contd
what is it you are so afraid of, that overshadows today killings
trying to temper public opinion that not all muslims are bad, duh.
yeah when did that happen in the west in this or last century
its was a war crime bush committed and obama supported
exactly when did i support them ? i agreed with your tweet about justice they should meet
like earth is a living lavatory and we are the experiment & amp ; are failing.
i literally have no idea who you are speaking to. who mentioned ph or incarceration ?
is he calling the executions ' bigotry ', b/c if so, it is not an appropriate euphemism
for his and his family is death !
get the difference between actions and words ? where was the last muslim slaughter in the west ?
these were actions considered heinous crimes, quite beyond bigotry.
i tweeted in support of 1st victim ! how is that disrespectful to the victims ?
fear is not my reason for believing in god. i have come close to death. twice.
i am talking about reality not stupid words that will never transpire obviously. enough now.
on the heels of your mantra
how is it obvious if so many people are tweeting their hate of all muslims ?
we must believe humans can stop behaving like this.
so you know what is been going on, what is the fear america will bomb isis positions ?
i am so confused. are you saying bigotry is not wrong ?
so your pro free speech but i can not disagree with those calling for deaths of innocent americans ?
humans for is up for debate, no proof
which are you afraid will be killed ?
yes i but forced assimilation policies of muslims threaten our freedom in general
not on the back of today is victims
sadly ... yes. humanity is getting more violent bad. evil every year.
i understand what side you are on, my bad.
but it is very unlikely to happen as pole who live currently are all brainwashed to believe
existence of god is dependent on brainwashing of young by each religion
maybe. but humans are definitely a failure whether it was evolution of god
yes there are some. most of them seem pretty bloodthirsty.
and i am not a.
the ppm i was referring to in tweet. many ppm understood that ! twitter was trending hash tags
are you seriously trying to convince me muslim terrorists are bad ? really ? um, no shit !
really if i read the eu'ran ... isis seems to portray the true islam
i am not getting it either.
after pearl harbor incarceration is different that execution
the twisted aka islamist extremists !
of course what psycho supports that ?
what are you talking to me ?? what mantra did i push ?
why not come out and explain instead of pretend to be offended ?
are you calling these executions ' bigotry ?
not angry and i saw no other ‚Äú multiple occasions ‚Äú, just the one.
i was supporting one of the people killed !!
you can be tad more respectful to today is victims of fanaticism not just idiotic words please

charlie hebdo massacre in paris carried out with military precision - gunmen appeared to seek out journalists by name ,
exactly. and the bigger the muslim population in europe, the more violence there will be.
i wager it will not - time for a revolution.
if only people did not hand out guns : jeffrey epstein also in car+trilateral commission
of course. to a it is never the fault of the actual attacker, especially minorities
the more western interference in other countries ' affairs, more militant regimes are formed

reason for this massacre is a concrete action of paper. not general principles of freedom.

well i respect people but not their beliefs if they do not warrant respect. simple.
we are arguing about 2 different points
this is but there are millions of muslims that condone this and rejoice at the killings !!
i see the bomber yelling any religious words !!
no. i supported action in syria as it happens
but do u consider them as terrorists ??
no actually it does not !!!!!!! wake up.
the was not fighting for jesus.
free speech gives people the right to do so.
it is not irrational fear when they actually kill you for satire and being an ‚Äú infidel ‚Äú !
religion is an extremely delicate subject. its belief and a lifestyle. insult that and you make enemies
jimmy was not alone in his actions either, so my analogy is sound.
honestly harry. you are embarrassing yourself. media swayed. read up the factual historical background.
been to northern lately ?
look ... killers and psychos and from everywhere and every culture and every religion !!
once again they are lunatics who do not quote ' god is great '
you reply makes no sense whatsoever with ?
after we saw the thousands of muslims rejoicing in the streets at the murders !!
not millions these are only a few who were fed lies there entire lives !!
where are the hundreds of christians rioting and killing for the defilement of christ ?
what do they call attacks on schools ?? just like the one carried out by taliban ??
we could have more world peace if we sought to understand each other better.
you are speaking historical gibberish. oh, btw : ‚Äú we have avenged the prophet ! ‚Äú
fuck off. that is not about islam
should be forbidden in the west as it is an ideology incompatible with our beliefs.
he was a lunatic. is a group that target vulnerable people because they can not fight back
but the majority even you have to admit that the media is biased about this !!
have you ever heard of timothy mcveigh ? he was called a domestic terrorist !
are carried out by but they radicalized after western attacks on their homes and families
just like the coward person who shot and killed kids in cold-blood at schools
look at your own country is history and you will see how sill you sound
they need more of an agenda.
extremely delicate for you. everyone else does not have to adhere to how you feel
if you think guns are the reason, you are a fool. the culprit is islam.
so after making an accusation you should back up with evidence of christian attacks on schools !!
if you want to be tolerated, learn to tolerate gays, women, jews, and christians.
guess what is in the west.
they r carried out by muslims ... they r nt terrorist attacks !!
2 attacks on military bases were called work place violence !! that is stupid !!
all people who commit acts that terrorizes should be called terrorist and nt only the muslim ones
you would not care what anyone says about islam. simple.
who married a 6 year old and raped her at 9.
however if a person committing the same crime is not muslim most probably will be considered sick psycho
a religion that instructs the murder of any follower that chooses to leave it is obviously evil.
at war with itself how is that ??
says who we are not out killing people. is that more noble than printing a picture ?
i am respectful of all people irrespective of sexual orientation, religion, and race
nothing hilarious about people getting killed. you are a disgrace.
to throw tantrums and murder innocent people. if you were so comfortable in your religious faith.
would be like me attacking all tv presenters because of the actions of jimmy seville
the media in our countries does whatever mean necessary to protect islam from criticism.
and millions of them condemning such violence !!
i think at your age you know that western media has got an agenda muslims
oops. northern ?
which is why i do not tolerate your religion.
racial is getting out of control.
racial is depicting someone a particular religion hold dear in an idiotic way
lets consider the us attacks on foreign soil !! lets consider the foreign invasions !! irak afghanistan ...
why do not u consider isis as lunatics bc they are !!
i know all their crimes ... is it really different from mass murdering children at a youths camp ??
more like at work.
that is funny they were cowards that put bombs by children and walked away quietly !!
how about we work the other way around two
that is because they have not labeled all attacks by muslims as terrorist acts !
religion and individuals are separate entities
id challenge because it is a violent religion in its most basic form. same with christianity.
yes it is. west is not necessarily a geographical region
and the only thing evolving is our means to carry out those same attacks.
seriously u r gonna jump on a single exception ??
why do so many verses call for death ?
the real question is where have you ever seen thousands of christians rejoicing for the killing of innocence ?
by whom the government or the media and the people
just because it is a delicate subject does not mean that it should be ignored.
families killed by the us for some oil ?? aremt they afghanistan people who had millions of their countrymen
it happened before with with religious white groups who killed black people and celebrated it !!
why would they as i believe they take this event proudly !!
yes it does. mockery is important, ridiculing daft beliefs is important.
most wars are started by a maniac who uses religion as their motive.

i suspect they were rather distracted. can not think why ...
but why precisely an id, why not siesta tablets ?
do not ask too many questions someone might accuse you of being a journalist
maybe the gunmen were better trained than the getaway driver ?

highly trained does not necessarily mean always smart.

i do that by paying my uk taxes and supporting my police and my army.
you are both right. this struggle is a collective responsibility. there is strength in unity against terrorism
then you are westernized or secular because you cannot blaspheme your deity or speak against your prophet !
agree its the collective struggle across the human race !
moderates should explicitly condemn such verses and habits that are used as basis rather contextualizing tm
of course but please forgive me if i consider muslim believers closer to this than myself f ex.
those are good things to speak against ! praise the lord !
perhaps they may have a better understanding. this is why we should engage with islamic communities more.
you are right. fear stems from evil. you breed it then you become it

some press now blurring charliehebdo cartoons as cartoonists foresaw . this one says " charlie hebdo should be veiled "
prayers for supports freedom of the press !
i think you mean rather than equivocation, right ? ie saying muslim/jew/catholic same
equivocation means prevarication as in the false equating of muslim, christian & amp ; jewish extremists
i condemn the cowardly attacks. terrorism is not religion. this inhumane. god bless everyone
a victory for those behind that barbaric act, alas.
looks like that rabbi has a bong.
that false equivocation did not save their live huh
we should expect next week is cover to be a full satirical portrait of the prophet.
that is safe enough the jews not going to kill you
standing up for freedom of speech , i am tweeting the cartoon my homage to the french martyrs
what is d significance of d stony silence of leftists ?
translation needed. without it is not making much impact.
i say it as atheist that live inside jewish-arab society-we should not rt pics that affect the religious feelings
dear in our imperfect reality by touching these super sensitive issues we serve our enemies.
a movie that is been stalled by censor board for two years for hurting christian sentiments
100 lashes if you are not dying of laughter ‚Äú
can someone translate what the cartoon says please ?
i know what you mean. just frustrating that some people express their issues by taking innocent lives
charlie hebdo : don‚Äôt blame this bloodshed on france‚Äôs muslims | nabila ramdani
very truth. why should they us, who carried it blames them. | manila rampant
they are responsible sold take d blame when jesus was abused no bloodshed why always them
stop the apology non sense.
. it is. no question.
that is your mere sluggish thinking. whosoever harms anyone needs to be reprimanded.
we will blame it on france is eskimos just to keep the peace loving muslims happy.
who is blaming all ? it is your violent beliefs that are getting scrutinized. nice straw man
i will blame two of france is muslims.
much respect to for this . seriously , thank you :

british press publish horrifying photos of police officer being murdered - but not charlie hebdo cartoons . strange values .
of course not. you have only got time for unthinking bigotry and hatred.
i would not thanks for the reply.
i see nothing wrong with it. it is the reality which is hidden and not felt.
did any newspaper publish the cartoons ? in india at least one newspaper has shown the courage
if you were a friend or relative of the murdered police officer, you might feel differently.
they are moral pure and simple.
is full of sniveling cowards these days. it is disgraceful.
because they are scared shirtless of the pc backlash. remember, the government panders to the minority.
values greed based system of inherited privilege enforced by state violence and inbred complicit courts.
my naive guess lots of terrorism/terrorists funding media
the press do not have values.
the is firmly under the jackboot of political correctness.
not paper. silly auto correct.
you know you have lost the debate when you start rattling off ‚Äú bigotry ‚Äú and ‚Äú islamophobia ‚Äú
press that does not publish the cartoons are cowards
same in craven and shameful.

well the gloves need to come off now
they are pathetic a twisted belief.

this is a tribute honoring the charlie held magazine staff
very impressed with the art statement. well done sister. blessed with many trips to fr.
well illustrated. freedom of press will always rise from the ashes. long live charlie held
60 seconds of .
too scared to put it on your front page though.
bluffers hold up the cartoons !
show the cartoon then ... come on
unconditional support for terrorists but crocodile tears over charlie held.
it is ok to criticize charlie hebdo : their cartoon of boko haram sex slaves as welfare queens :
to stand with this work in death. but that does not invalidate heinousness of crime.
i am not made fun of people like me and their pain every fucking day.
what are you even saying.
exactly. it is really disrespectful to ask people charlie did not stand for in life & gt ;
so this of held is not working for me.
yes. it is like how fucking hard is to be like murder and racism is bad ?!
obviously not a good but this cartoon presumably has some context.
well that is not offensive. sarcasm intended. thanks for the translation.
has been socialized by most ignorant westerners who think anyone who is or shares similarities with middle easterners
rt it is ok to criticize charlie held and their cartoons : ‚Äù
. certainly to criticize. not ok to defend those who killed them.
not justifying the murders but that cartoon looks pretty frigging racist. i do not read french !
i hope you realize that islam is not a race
when literally no one has said anything of the sort ??
to all my muslim friends : you do not need to apologize for the attack in paris . a criminal
agreed always is but not publicized as it should be ... currently on national news condemning
you are a brave young man.
exactly if only the media and the wider community could also understand this ..... islam is not the problem
have you read the duran ? do you know shit ?
the never asks muslims to kill in the name of god or kill at all
finally someone that is a decent human bag hahn x
this has nothing to do with the topic we were discussing
read the i but you will not.
there is an elephant in the room ..... the q has several versions only does not kill ppm.
shame. i agree with his views on israel.
do not be so single minded.
you should read peter ‚Äú questioning islam ‚Äú ...... i have, but you will not.
of course they are not taught correct islam, do not generalize the case
the says that whoever kills an innocent is killing the entire human race so what are you saying
there are going to be an awful lot of muslims in hell, would not you agree ?
and this is an actual verse in duran
book contains no opinion ... he shows each contradiction from original or accepted texts.
it is a peaceful some people practicing it is simply not
media had their part to play too, they have to give more air time to moderates.
god was telling that he is with the muslims, strengthening them and putting faith in their hearts
yea. i do know shit
you should read book because its historically revealing. the contradictions in q are many.
who is dis is gleeful, revenge is so sweet
try reading i with 0 grudges
the first victim in the attack was a police officer guarding the building. his name ? ahmed,
unlike the you do not interpret the duran the way you want to
alas yes. never read holy book w so many passages railing angst unbelievers
we are discussing the voracity of verse which promote killing. i have shown you hat.
an estimated 6000 jews left france last year and the international media paid no heed :
c among 35 hrs of sun per year is not enough ?
there‚Äôs shed it was a huge story
is not big on detail according to a mate of mine who knows him.
he is not that stupid.
fairly well covered to me.
or this one it was even on the bbc
hi perhaps this will be of interest to you
you pothead. insinuating that an ethnic group shares the same character traits is racism fuck yourself
judging a whole group by the actions of individuals is the definition of racism.
obviously that is everyone else is fault ...
not once have the media discussed the possibility of further terror attacks following from the latest atrocity
even covered it
go kiss more fascist thanks tosser
why mass immigration at all ? pay british women those billions wasted on non-brits for babies. ¬£5k/mo for1
he is pointing out they left for reasons of feeling insecure due to attacks by muslim/anti-semites
they have no choice and do not want to be labeled racist by having strong border controls.
sure but the people killed recently were not jewish. every westerner should feel insecure there.
shear. i am saying climates of political intolerance are a bad thing for minorities.
ah so coverage is not coverage. that skip ‚Äú real world ‚Äú view shining through.
have you actually read the duran, dumas and faiths associated with muslim subjection and racism
footballers doing the ' gesture ' and no reports that this is all done in name of islam
that is so awful !!! do you think we can survive ?
shear. would you not describe islamist politics as intolerant, as well as being violent ?
not what i said. i said skip was a racist party. and it is.
an estimated zero enlisted on 9. 12 to fight their ‚Äú war on terror ‚Äú
i have to my local chinese takeaway actually refers to himself as ‚Äú the chunky ‚Äú.
to drive the hatred further against muslims.
of course everyone who supports jews or stands up for them is zionist always the answer
do not you mean 6 million ?
do you consider it a racial slur to use the word jock, spouse or ginger ?
that is because of the weather !
they neglected to post articles in the volume that really should have been required.
gets better you seriously trying to compare islamic terror to skip policy ?!?
it started in with shortage of people for certain jobs so brought in from other countries.

enlighten me as to why racial slur an is acceptable and racial slur b is not.
try the links i just tweeted. nigel is claim is nonsense.
you‚Äôre defending the use of a racial slur, and i‚Äôm the narrow-minded one. incredible.
no it is not i have in france and that statement is utter bullshit.
is it racist to favor immigrants because of their geographical relevance ? i.e. the predominantly white eu migrants ?
as within the 140 character limit, no.
. except for all the coverage of it you can find simply by goggling ...
which is not what claimed.
an estimated zero enlisted on 9. 12 to fight their ‚Äú war on terror ‚Äú
do not watch you mean what is going on in france ?
or said differently ... 6,000 millionaires left last year due to high taxes. nigel ...
pouting out is wrong does not equal trolling.
i never saw it on any news channel or on any front pages
suggest you turn on the news right now buddy.
and got it wrong. worse he twisted the facts to suite his cause, grossly offensive !
no. they have been focusing on how muslims are the victims in this event.
presumably you also find it okay to use the n-word because black people use it, then.
. it is scary what politics of intolerance can do really is not it ?
but nobody should be using that word if they do not want certain ppm using it.
not grass roots no. but i know who this works now.
man of care to explain
widespread racism is still racism. i don‚Äôt know why you can‚Äôt get your head around this.
why are the media singular concerned about how an islamic attack will affect muslims.
not at all. i do it all the time and i am conservative catholic.
i think we both know origins of that word and why that is different.
not that facts ‚Äô ever bother you and your racist party.
yes they should be worried but there has been specific aggression all over europe to jews
racism is still racism.
why would it matter what you are called though if that is what the english want ?
minor figures. is led by a blatant, unrepentant racist.
an estimated zero enlisted on 9. 12 to fight their ‚Äú war on terror ‚Äú
blah. i know of no racist supporters personally.
wow. you are having a nightmare.
why are you trying to argue with using facts ? are not you a patriot ?
and why would it concern an uk politician ?
i think it was pretty good, widespread and high profile. always room for more.
newspapers : put the mohammed cartoon on your front page tomorrow . show them who is running this .
yes does seem to be weak in that department and many others e.g. no support for police.
this is a great idea. but will not happen, unfortunately.
terror is winning. emboldened by our muslim terror loving president who refuses to condemn it.
yes is what the extremists want, whether so called muslims or christians.
the is a flux religious war between conservatives !
conservatives say no more.
basically the same thing as vandalizing a synagogue because you are mad at the israeli government. awful
i like your angle the more they try stop us the more we offend them
not only does not support our police he actively opposes them

i am shaking with rage at the attack on charlie hebdo . it is an attack on the free world
for they did not get this ‚Äú attention/compassion ‚Äú, did not provocateur anyone, just lived their lives
hell you there. shhhh. your generation got us here. stfu.
response must be both merciless and respectful of our legal system. period
much obviously not of wwii was fought strategically. and then we won.
this is with those remarks completely nuts or a servant to comparing with ww2 ?
i do not judge you. i despair of you and wish you well.
how do you think would have responded to radical non-violence ?
i meant to respond to roger cohen is statement about hitler.
you could have been tweeting that in german.
so silly ... your words about paris attack. get real
i am sure he said exactly the same when brain murdered 77 people, mostly kids.
come on keep on breathing please, take a deep breath
at whom should this violence be directed beyond the specific perpetrators, and what form should it take ?
would you mind leaving that coward paper out of my mentions ? thanks.
here is a lesson ' humanity ' just does not seem to learn
a suitable attitude towards this attack, with resp tall cia killed
but are right france/the free world should respond ruthlessly to the us ............
more violence is never an answer to violence. never was. never will be.
what should that ' ruthless ' response look like ?
indeed. it is easier to respond with violence to a nation-state than this.
i reckon that‚Äôs exactly the intended reaction.
wrong. was in 1941. is now
feel same about you are blind. cest lave
the free world did not act ruthlessly in 1941.
that is not my war. ask me to help for peace and i will say yes.
we should respond in unity. not with more violence.
as i sad an attack prob initiated by to get france/eu on us-sde in war against terrorism
it began to. and then it did.
help me out here. i am getting bored.
you are loosing your time. psychopaths do not listen.
and who or what do you think saved them ? pacifism ????
the world needs this viewpoint a lot more .
go to and read hitler is religious views. he hated church and was fan of islam
was not a ? hahaha, this is the murder of history ....
was a roman catholic. the bible and roman catholicism is on two opposite spectra.
comments like this are the problem ....
its fact. according to germans should have adopted more suitable religion like islam.
that is an easy way ... but there are millions of violent muslims ...
by liberal are not you supposed to tolerate bigots ? because that hijacks your logic.
as opposed to a genocide of millions caused by an ideology. jog on pal
stop your liberal ass licking. violence is inherent in islam
was not stupid
i followed you for a reason. brainwashed bigots have no place in society.
calling bill gates an ethical person is my main problem with that image.
and still the worst genocides in history are from christians.
a religion is definitely in question if it condones the murder of unbelievers.

condemning all instead of the few extremists responsible is disgusting. they are not to blame.

you are enjoying your freedom of speech. how does it feel to not get killed for it.

and the moderates idly standing by are as responsible as the radicals.
i am saddened by your discrimination ideals and herbage.
it is like listening to drivel, a single fact will do not your prejudiced rantings -
then your claim that it was an ‚Äú indisputable fact ‚Äú is a lie !
all you are showing me is you have the intellectual capacity and maturity of an infant gnat.
that is kind of like asking quakers to do something about westboro baptists.
you argue like a 12 year old you know.
it is not it is fear & amp ; anger at barbarism.
you sound just like people who ' argue ' against evolution.
that is pathetic you told me it was an ‚Äú indisputable fact ‚Äú you lied ! simple really
ha you have not given me a single fact
... the death of culture and massive division.
no such as a good muslim.
done a very good way of fighting back against, and.
want to consider the ghettos, the inevitable racism ?
ironically and the terrorists share the same twisted belief that different cultures can not coexist
try to dispute it then.
i am not making i am calling a spade.
no one surpasses and in terms of and.
what would you intelligence agencies can not stop these nut jobs
its not my opinion that immigrants ghettoize and act socially according to their own identities and interests.

not very familiar with westboro in the uk.

will they help protect innocent civilians, stand up to terror or just talk ?

cowardly attack on charlie hebdo is offices . the humourless fanatics can fuck off . freedom of speech is more
ma that is never the right way to reply
. freedom of speech antagonist to islam is not done.
. freedom of speech for whom ?
attack on freedom of speech its strategy wants coalition ground troops in theaters. adnani called for this
like killing 11 people is actually worse than them making fun of a religion
is more important than an imaginary medieval merchant who lives in the fucking sky.
no where safe no where to run ?
i am thinking that on many occasions, the ' cowardly ' characterization of those attacks is redundant.
deliberate provocation an act of war in asymmetrical warfare
. freedom of speech antagonist to islam is not done.
then you have not been shot.
with 10 killed this was probably the last edition.
yes , they drew first . do not ever be silent , do not ever be ignorant . we stand
letting these idiots out of the middle east was like opening the gates of hell.

how stupid ... liberalism kills when leaving you unprotected
did they cry when bombed lydia ?
no no it is for charlie and pro marine le pen.
sad that violence and death are used as a means of spreading religious belief ... rip to the victims
when they catch the killers they should put 1000 pencils in his ants
citizens arm yourselves. do not count on weak politicians to allow police to protect society.
there always exist the opposite ex good vs bad. hence use pencil wisely
they can shove the pencil up three asses, muslims are slaughtering and we are showing pencils low
the attack on charlie hebdo is likely to radicalize all sides in the debate about islam and islamism . that
not necessarily so. what is important is that those who are responsible for this be caught. 1/2

your jerk knee reaction was indicative though. i doubt your tweet will preempt anything

clearly you have a problem with language you can not be preemptive and knee jerk oxymoron
what is prompting ???

what is the translation ?
you shouted ' allahu akber ' whilst murdering others ? you are a disgrace to my religion . may the
despicable act even the prophet would not endorse it !
if you are such a ‚Äú good ‚Äú muslim go take your religion back from the jihadists.
your words are meaningless unless you take action against those who murder innocents in the name of
congrats on your tweet !
your words mean nothing until you take action against the kkk and the christian thugs in african countries
any killing overt or covert can never be justified. taking life or desecrating faith is terrorism.
hello what kind of action are you referring to ? and are christians responsible for kkk ?
yep these are such loving christians point is i do not hold all christians responsible
you condemn on social media and celebrate behind closed doors.
was that who killed 2000 people in nigeria ? nope ! it was peace loving muslims
these guys until christians fight these groups they are just as guilty too
very much allows even if done on prophet (pbuh)
means is that the violent cult you refer to ?
as a muslim , i find the murder of innocent people more despicable and offensive than any cartoon could ever
do not hesitate to let me know if you change your mind.
i have many friends and this murder is not done in their names
fully it is criminals using religion to hide the crimes
well said. agree with you.
innocent people repent and turn to the lord jesus christ
if that is already then it does not really matter.
but the question is are the makers of such cartoons innocent ?
as a all i can do i support freedom of speech
thank you. i appreciate your courtesy in asking.

in case you are confused . check who is the terrorist and who is the .
the terrorist was also a muslim. that fact does not disappear because majority of other muslims disagree
very they will take comfort in a phrase anna lillahi wei inner ilay-hi raji'on ‚Äú

so if you are against generalizations (and so do i) this is for you

was built up by cia+mos sad for killing people, muslims and others.
is he not a terrorist and an islamist ?
i know my and it is that distancing islam from the issue is willful ignorance.
if you do it is a major sin in islam ... i sure as hell can
the guy with the gun is both.
you are saying that like i have said something to the contrary.
for orders sold. rt : in case you are confused. . ‚Äù
and that not only according to history but also according to duran and sun nah
the point is not all muslims are terrorist.
when everyone else has a part in it too.
it is not about distancing it, it is about saying, muslims ‚â† terrorists.
the guy with the gun would have probably said the same about the other guy.
nobody has done that ... the picture is saying which one is a terrorist and which is the muslim
in case you are confused. check who is the terrorist and who is the. ‚Äù
you can not actively manage the radicalization issue in islam if you deny it even exists.
so incredibly sad. just devastating for him and his family x
tragically so. i think their sub-theological drivers, however base, should be addressed and exposed
there are plenty of other faiths that have been used to justify atrocities.
he is but to say mere no terrorist ' decouples the religious/ideological component of his motivation.
god we belong and to him is our return '
that is because of law !! arab were more open minded and had more freedom before islam
so rather than some tangent in which you act like i have said all muslims should be shot.
killing a person unless in self defense, is like killing the whole of mankind in islam
much too kind mags. x
nowhere does it say that the terrorist is not a muslim
in case you are confused. check who is the terrorist and who is the. ‚Äù
read u will come to know the punishment of blasphemy
i do not engage with conspiri-freaks. go holler in a well.
you have missed the point though. the terrorist is not representative of mainstream muslims.
does not mean the entire community should be subject to abuse.
incredible to see universal outrage in over , but double standards when it comes to attacks on .
attacks are part of the violence-begats-violence cycle, this is about cartoons causing violence
so now is unafraid to call them terrorists.
part of brotherhood quest to dominate world with caliphate. after israel they want andalusia.
did not condemn attacks like the barry bombing ? i believe they did.
one can do both. it needs to be said. palis exactly the same as held killers.

egypt top muslim institution al azhar and the arab league condemn paris attack .
what about reigning in your muzzle breathier !!!!!!!
are we supposed to be grateful. do not believe a word they say
when are they going to call for a jihad against them ?
about time some bodies took a stand against the terrorists
what really is involved while condemning ? any steps taken to avoid it from reoccurring ?
but they will get angry if someone insults their religion/prophet within their own boundaries.
words are wind. the league is as useless and corrupt as the.
the same ones supporting and the other tyrants in mo ? very reliable people !
did they condemn the heir of synagogue massacre in jerusalem ?
the league can stop terrorism. they support it instead.
thats what they say but inside they are very happy
only jew-hatred explains why europeans pretend israel is enemies are not the west is , as muslims murder jews and
i am beginning to see that. at least it is appearing to be that way from here.
thanks. i do plan on doing more research
well i doubt we will agree on everything but can respect that.
why would they they run the joint !
best and his books
you rock that is all .....
they can not be ignorant enough to think otherwise.
have been the ones promoting non white immigration, now this is the result. thanks jews.
many do not realize that jews, whilst they may hate muslims, hate christians more.
maybe it would not be europeans problem if israel did not control the foreign agenda of the west.
basically because they are a minority they have interest in creating chaos and discharging nationalism in others
and they guaranteed a clash by treating muslims better than natural citizens.
shows how brainless imbeciles all european lefties are. disgusting.

why western nations are dropping their troops in middle-east

then why do people who follow islam seems to be making those sorts of attacks so often ?

this is why i and other muslims will not apologize for the charlie hebdo attacks
double standard are never asked to condemn christian nut jobs.
it was an illegal war and blare and bush should go on trial as terrorists
anyone with any sense whatsoever understands this and would not expect an apology from a muslim.
pretty sure i do. do you even lift ?
expect the same of a christian as a muslim if under the same circumstance.
tell us again y women have2make themselves invisible2men, its men thoughts that r dirty not women is bodies
a if for those who say muslims do not condemn :
have you apologized for the iraq war yet ?
make it clear that is not what your faith, religion, cult stands for.
well i think the responsibility for action lies on the actor not a book written approx 1500 years ago
you have added very little to this thread.
religion. i appreciate your view though, and i do see your point.
what does that graphic have to do with islam ? read this :
catcher and the rye never killed anyone it is a book.
until has stifled criticism of itself, this is no longer viable,
many were very outspoken against the war in iraq.
really do you not know your history and the sequence of events ?
i would like to apologize for the kkk and westboro baptist church. oh .... wait ...
are. sadly us humans are quite easily influenced.
leaders would come and condemn the massive amounts of bigotry, and hate in their
i am i do apologize for my country is actions when i disagree.
condemn those that use that belief system to justify violent, or criminal acts.
chapeau , george packer and , for telling it exactly as it is .
a lot of early medical and nursing advances, public health etc ; so yes.
time to update the ' no true scotsman ' fallacy ?
oh did they that is interesting.
hopefully people will not give the extremists the war they are trying to start.
arguments convince people of things ; killing them can not possibly do that.
except those who are beyond reasonable discussion. deprogramming a life of brainwashing ai not easy ...
have you been asleep for the past 11 years ???
fuck off you disingenuous troll.
any examples of this galvanization that you or i could not do without it ?
having a giggle at a sky fairy is rude, sure, but not grossly insulting.
both sides wants a war. the moderates are the ones who will suffer the most
i believe religion exists and these views are held sincerely by some people and less so by others.
or is slaughter only evil when it happens to people who look like you ?
there are all sorts of religious nuts, extremists in every camp. but free speech is universal.
stealing is a crime. murder due to sacred insult is directly religious. pure cowardice orbit.
packer for telling it exactly as it is. via
you can have your that is your right. even if its wrong.
oh were the journalists torturing these muslim thugs ?
is there no act of barbarism that will sufficiently stun self hating liberals into ceasing their apologia
what slaughter and torture are you referring to ?
i am not so sure unfortunately. the fascist politics in france already try to start it.
if that were true surely they would go after the people harming them rather than innocents ?
they also got threats when they did stuff about christian in fact. great article.
. everyone should read this article.
because torture and slaughter on a mass level are so much less outrageous than what happened yesterday
specifically so you can pretend that things are not interrelated ? i do not play that game
packer and, for telling it exactly as it is. ‚Äù
you know full fucking well how one thing relates to another.

do a little search on twitter and you will find plenty like this
i am not talking about the attackers. self-evidently. i am talking about hatred against an entire community
yes that is a worry, particularly after the recent demos in germany.
thanks for putting a few sandbags down before the tidal wave of reductionist chat flares up on here
fair enough. i obviously do not get the traffic you get.
journalists , admin staff and police officers among those injured in attack
well they asked for the violence knowing not to push the boundaries of journalism by targeting any religion

so why provoke why push the boundaries ? why
allow that filth in your country and this is what you get.

that is not the point. re-read my comment.
it does have a place. it is reserved for stupid cunts.
. typical. no coherent response. i doubt you did understand it, with literacy like that.
condemnation insufficient. explanation prevention ?
mocking the color of someone is skin is an affront to arbitrary genetic differences.
mockery of any ones religion is not acceptable. be it islam, christianity etc
fuck off with your stupid shit. thanks. bye.
actions speak louder than words.
because only do what normal muslims tell them to do, right ?...
unlike you are somewhat forced to practice your own skin color. . .
you'v us created the ideology and directing it 2 islam as whole forgetting th point in discussion
it is perfectly acceptable to mock voluntarily accepted extremist ideology. essential, actually.
you toss em up and i will just brainlessly splat them !
right in there with a right hook. lmao.
but the leaders of the muslim community are obvious by their absence ....... as usual ....
. are you expecting a joint press release from 1. 6bn people ?
but can mock their personal belief via different means
black so and so and proclaim it is your right of speech
any word from the humans condemning the attack yet ? no thought not.
: everything you need to know about the magazine that refuses to be censored
interesting choice of covers given that the attackers were not catholic michael jackson fans.
print the cartoons. do not be fearful.
everything except any themed cartoons ‚Ä¶
you mean char not stephanie

extremely brave choice of illustrations. are you not scared of furious michael jackson fans ?

why there is no blasphemy law in france
as a muslim , killing innocent people in the name of islam is much , much more offensive to me
communists were and are not religious. yesterday one blew herself up in turkey !
share article or book i must read or ur quoting might be out of context
which means it is not on the same level ... quit with the selective understanding
no a select few of fucked up people attacked paris not muslims fucked up people
you can not be serious that is selective understanding in a nutshell !
plus this newspaper has done cartoons about islam and lived a former attack in 2011.
it is unconfirmed who the attackers were (there were previous attacks by fascists)
i am even then killing is not justifiable. killing is never justifiable.
nobody is animal here. and i am defending innocent people not these terrorists
president cal either university approves killing & amp ; maiming christians, jews+other infidels.
article of scholar u were referring back provide it
ended up in bloodshed. and now this. violence. root : beliefs.
yeah. true. always try to high jack idea.
you had no choice to be muslim. you were told to be one.
not all will see them as innocent people
you really compare a cartoon and a kill ?
i do not at but killing 11 people ? it is a disgrace to islam.
they just said ' u akbar '
yes they exist but my point was every terrorist outrage carried out today is perpetrated by muslims
everyone can be seen as a terrorist depending on where you are in your life
go fuck yourself you hideous tramp
creates violence. not acknowledging it is bad. not all muslims are bad.
yeah police officers innocents cartoonist did provoke and disrespected religion responsible for their acts
and what is it ??? muslims killing muslims ... or christians ??
oh now that is dead, your logic is basically muslims being victims of terrorism
and your type of ignorance is no different from jihads types. two sides of the same coin
what difference does it make ? they obviously felt what they did was making a religious statement.
he is saying it is not on the same level.
pal. the practitioners of your ‚Äú religion ‚Äú are animals.
no. and were atheist and the biggest terrorists.
you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. do you actually know any muslims ?
everyone can mock for christ is sake ! see, just done it ...
are you defending these animals ? why is islam overflowing with murderers ?
go write an opera gold
the biggest terrorists the world has ever seen is the us. they kill millions
you said all terrorists are muslim.
there is answer. keyboard warrior
all terrorists are ira ? eta ? bader manhood ? well you learn something every day.
are you a supporter of genital mutilation ? child rape ?
i could not agree more.
the majority yes and those responsible are pure scum but think how many muslims
i do not know if you read french but this is what we know.
cleric confirms your prophet was pedophile & amp ; rapist. but you would still kill for him
things perhaps work differently in real world !
why do want 2 live in dissolute places like france/uk/usa/canada ? please explain.
he is saying the reaction is disproportionate to the apparent offending cartoon. he is condemning it.
fundamentalist beliefs are an anachronism in a modern world. they will disappear in time
too much doing shit. too little protests from muslim on shit they do.
i do agree but we must make sure no provoking 2 heat up and get worse in killing s
hi still waiting for an answer to my question.
i am talking about today you cretinous wank stain you forgot to mention guy fawkes idiot
how do you know the killers are muslims and they killed in the name of islam ?
yes if he does say that he must be held responsible
if artiest i do not mock u either. there is respect and nothing disgusting
so he was a terrorist ? imagine that !
you are allowed and rewarded for killing non muslim. you will go to heaven for it
1 terrorist v how many muslim you do the maths you cretinous wank stain
very much so. fortunately of. ) , only the religious use guns
do not categorize a whole religion because some people are fucked up
is bigotry. by the way, you are an insufferable cunt who fully deserves sharia.
you never said today. tool.
not u have wrong information. egypt homes ancient christians.
i condemn not just any gov is recklessness in being involved in killing innocent.
maybe they are from
it saith it is much more.
you said all terrorists were muslim. i corrected you with facts.
no bro mocking religion is against ethics cause hate in society
is and is a cunt.
why is it can openly declare kill affair + disrespect other religions but not vice verse
this shows how related he is. ignorance is a disease.
your ideology is just too sick.
not all are terrorists ; yet all terrorists are muslim. let is not wear blinders today.
does that make him a non-terrorist ?
yes. the freedom of speech and expression. have a blessed day gamer.
they obviously do not realism that islam is 1. 7 billion people worldwide
do u agree that most terrorist acts in recent years are in the name of islam ?
so in not aloud to disrespect a bunch of crazy people who murdered people doing a funny job üòÇ
give me a fucking ' break. goddamned melissa. you are better than that.
first of all in not american, and secondly do you have a problem with christian ism ?
white is not a homogeneous culture. neither is islam.
all very subjective criteria. the bullets shot in the name of allah were all too real !
shit be upon any mother fucker american who does not identify this as a muslim attack on france.
there must be equal respect and equality because v r humans and have 2 share the earth with diversity
and you are mother she is christian motherfucker ???
do feel people should be killed for leaving islam ?
you are rehearsing is tenets, not islam. you seemed to ignorant about topic
how would you propose to limit his freedom of speech ? would you issue a fatwa on him ?
where does it say that ? chapter ? verse ? hadith ?
it is all over the news you cretin
we do not know for sure. this is too soon but that gives us an idea ...
absolutely not. it is basic freedom of speech. which also allows you to argue back.
so the never killed 6million people mainly jews ?
cartoons were drawn in why are they attacking now ? shouting allah akbar is not proof
there are in this world should we judge them all because of a few
is it too much to ask that we lose the political correctness for 1 day ? it was muslims
yes they did. just not in the name of christianity.
go back to old school and kick your english teacher is ass. they failed you horribly.
... lemma guess u all nt regret was u r saying
now shouted akbar. did it make u muslim ?
indeed where did he go ?
why now i cannot say ...
todays terrorist is tomorrows freedom fighter ... nelson mandela rings a bell ?
i may criticism but sure no disrespect or mocking. u can criticize but in respectable way
f'ed up who happen to be radical muslims, were attackers. deal w/ it.
just do not blame the whole religion that is not right
if you hate on a whole religion for actions of few people then your an idiot
and u r confusing with muslims. now go try to learn some facts.
freedom of speech you fucking idiot if you do not like it fucks off back to your mud hut
because you have a muslim name does not make you a muslim.
i have seen ignorant but hey lets welcome the worst of them
i have no idea what is saying.
back match ya fucking fat pig. stuff your ass with a pork chop.
it is for you to rape non muslim. you are allowed.
today is a day we lose all this bullshit political correctness. muslims attacked paris. m-u-s-l-i-m
created by attacked by christians isis by christ what fuck u want fr muslim
do you see raping children ? beheadings in vatican city ?
these will be difficult and sad times. thank you for those words
each week this journal kids about every religion ...
which tenets do i rehearse ? that was saudi assertion.
a sock trying to be numerous fail we only hung it because it looked like your mam
if you are it makes you shout allah u akbar.
they were not killed because they were white. come on.
save it for the hair üòÑüòúüòÉ
plenty of white people have killed muslims. 3) isis predominantly kills muslims.
the also says that all religions shall be respected a terrorist that says differently is lying.
you should have some text interpretation lessons, lad ...
then i wonder when extreme jews or christians are gonna attack. hmmm. ?
you are forced to be one.
unfortunately incidents like this not only result in senseless slaughter, but also spark sweeping anti-religious sentiment.
so the solution is killing ?
no mocking nor disrespect but this would also be subjective so i apologize
agree. criticize me
the terrorist brain killed 78 people in norway. not a muslim. keep to facts please.
tragedy both events are horrendous and deserve to be executed but not a whole religion
certainly we cannot argue on all fronts of society. point is limit 2 freedom of speech is vital
and how many of these ancient coptic christians have been murdered for their religion ?
people will commit horrendous acts no matter on there religion
that that requiring you to murder, allowing you theft and rape.
yes there is tolerance and right to practice other religion for people of those religions
your quiet possibly the most ignorant delusional idiot known to man
how eloquently put your mother would be proud of you.
yep. attacking while not right, feels more like a fight than shooting civilians cartoonists somehow
it is not just a few people : islamic nations still execute for blasphemy etc.
for yes it seems to be.

there must be limits on freedom of speech. such mag provoke hate and outcome we witness
this very concept is bone of contention and being used to provoke
not real if strong can the world along better learn 2 respect or lest no disrespect
no they simply slaughter. does that make terrorism no terrorism ?
since they b were not family guys not applicable in above clause
freedom of expression u idiot so fuck off
i never said a name made you a muslim ? üòÇüòÇ
is killing too many muslims everyday all over the world. have u ever condemned
people got massacred today. playing the white supremacy card is utterly moronic.
but many and much more are legitimizing it in the community
but majority are talking as if they exactly know attackers and their motivations
i do not know this guy nor agree with his ideas nor he authority islam
yes i was referring to armed chap right to hit trigger now fuck off
u cannot expect people to stay cool while u keep mocking them
u are absolutely ignorant of importance of religion. ur brian is so small 2 comprehend it
your prophet himself was a monster you cretin !
that was a really stupid remark
with due respect freedom of speech is not infinite. french gov better had taken action against them
i mean mocking religion is disgusting. but killing people in the name of religion is worse.
you are allowed to steal from non muslim. you will still go to heaven.
but that ideology that you defend so blindly is just disgusting.
you should explain yourself better you monkey hanging useless cunt.
potentially this years most ignorant statement. i sincerely hope it was irony.
who is the terrorist in the little kids eyes who is parents have been shot by our military ?
scholar article. u r citing is out of context
i was referring to the journalists right to publish a cartoon you wank stain
but you can not kill people for publishing a cartoon. get over it.
your idea of expression is a bit worse !
oh that is another one
in that case you are a pseudo-liberal appeaser of islam, which is worse.
grand highest muslim religious authority, supports murdering non-muslims
you can not accuse all muslims of being terrorists.
they did not shout see eds. face facts you pig.
you are missing the point.
you do not read that much, do you ?
i condemn their killing. they deserve same right 2 live as others
kindly share source i never heard such a thing
a voice of reason please shout it loud not all muslims are terrorists but all terrorists are muslim
did not kill because of religion. educate itself :
and a disgrace of humanity ???
for mare fact that you are muslim, and the other is not, is disgusting.
yes with due respect and no harsh feelings. peace
mocking yes is valid but ethics and limits must be applied
the says there shall be no compulsion in religion
even the second one is not correct, kkk, tamil tigers, jewish terrorist groups are not muslims
they joked at every religion you fucking moron. only your backwards fuckers kill because of it. cunt

you are a disgrace to the founding principles of your country
but also sometimes because of it. herein lies the difference
that does not mean you kill them ? people have freedom of speech, as does the press.
any religion that can not roll-on-the-ground laugh at itself needs to completely re-evaluate itself
this is confirmed on tv. you can hear the killers scream allow akbar.
i never stated he did because he was christian but the comment that all terrorists

yes what did cartoonists ever do for us !
think how our upbringings would have suffered without knowledge of dennis the menace or desperate dan !
today is cartoon , by .
be calm. be dear paris. resist to be calm.
sad thing is that they kill because they are unable to laugh
you have let us all down. should have printed a ch cartoon.
today is by. ‚Äù
you could not print this in queens-land ...
a big to the cowards : rt : today is cartoon, by. ‚Äù
while the bbc and uk press shamed themselves yesterday censoring cartoons you know who reprinted them ? al jazeera .
i think whatever moral wrongness there is in censoring racist cartoons is negated by its ubiquitousness.
suppose holocaust did not happen ?
i am not sure where the double standards are .... explain ?
anyway all non are animals. just jews are too.
i am atheist. it is all freedom of speech. we have laws to prevent incitement to violence/hatred
not gonna answer the question then ?
i hate conspiracy theories and anti zionist rhetoric
good i disagree and am therefore obtuse and they say the art of conversation is dead
agree to disagree. and not all of them were racist (although that is not really important)
you think censoring racist cartoons is bad ?
i do not hate you and wish for you the best
again referring to main stream media showing double standards.
i am atheist so fucked according to all three abraham religions. as such i ignore all bigoted talk
probably one of the better more impartial news channels out there.
what i am saying is muslims are not a race
you might also be surprised to learn who else is offended by satire
the francophone press all over the world reproduced the cartoons. the british or american press ? nah ...
that is racially stereotyping middle easterners as muslims.
and will you resign on principle if they do not ?
why are we talking about you ? thought the discussion was about freedom of speech ! typical atheists
blah blah. do not read hebrew
the hello cartoons are not racist
i agree. can not answer my question then ?
it is a simple yes or no question.
has its jihad bond sides. they are not going to get murdered for that.
final defending free speech involves defending all speech even if you find it abhorrent
you should not. i it seems, for things you hate
cartoon suggests anti bias in censorship, while mostly not reprinting cartoons out if ‚Äú sensitivity ‚Äú
are you seriously saying a cartoon that racially stereotypes muslims is not racist ?
how is satirizing taking the piss out of religion racist ?
which assertion is wrong please discuss
it is about double standards ' thicko ! why not have equal standards ?
i think portraying as hook nosed stereotypes is just ever so slightly racist.
i have a mensch default setting, which is to disagree with you ! will not on this
so you criticize me for stopping your free speech by criticizing your attack on free speech ??
my only once again a religion is not a race.
will you be reprinting them in your sun article ?
so racial stereotyping is not being racist to you ?
i do not make that call, if i did, we would print them
almost as if they are using racial stereotypes or something ! * shock *
not to not when they are completely ubiquitous on the internet now.
yes and i have a right to be offended, insult you back and complain.
you are talking crap. i do not get into conversation with holocaust deniers
is a great guy
each of those assertions is very wrong. if you like we can discuss.
can you explain this tweet ? please
which is racist you surely cannot be this obtuse.
i hate all all wrong
it would require an interesting definition of race though would not it
glad u finally got it !
how am i not having equal standards ?
that word racist. i do not think it means what you think it means.
i presume that means are a race ? and rastafarian ? jedis maybe ?
seriously are you so stupid ! who said you are showing double standards ?
the certainly events concerning qatar) , main service dramatically less so though.
thanks for the colloquialism person i give no fucks about.

people worldwide are breaking out their pens to pay tribute to shooting victims :
your probably correct we have many friends that are not are friends at all.
this have cross the line of limits.
behind these can be quite non-muslim putin

sharia + faith + jihad
mocking is chasing god chased around toilets
people r so they do not understand satire !!! those terrorists also did not understand satire.
do you have an issue with being a muslim or statistics ?
otherwise there is no way out.
i think was being sarcastic ‚Äú !!
what happened in was tragic but it does not represent islam. tiny sick minority
several liberals ‚Äú are saying that the magazine ‚Äú deserved ‚Äú it for the cartoons
is about the conquest and conversion of the all world to islam.
faith what faith have you got if you can not stand a little mocking ?
mocking it was a satire. not mocking. .
are you saying you approve of the killing as a response to someone mocking your faith ?
the present day real is those who are following the duran to the letter.
with their jihad they are exactly following mohammad is jihads.

cult of murderers and pedophiles
yeah the nation is riding the hindu wave atm. what can be done ?
we r tolerant that is why we release. is much liberal.
tell is lovers what happened in paris.
so pk represents but do not apply stereotype % on other religions
where is the brigade ? dont want to during
should reform and accept a secularism, division of the state and religion.
that logic think what should have done to
giving up the sharia law & amp ; jihad it will continue breeding violence as the past centuries.
i am curious about your 99% blissful muslim statistics. where did you get the figure ?
without the moral and financial support of community one cannot run global terror. fyi its way above 1%
blissful where did you get this figure ?

and the shootings probably not motivated by religion, really
also dangerous is jumping to conclusions with minimal evidence, as i said before.
that is what i thought as well but let is not nitpick this one. üòä
then what do those specific statements mean to you ? please enlighten me.

apparently satire to make a point about being terrorized into self-censorship mystifies canadians.
nothing overt racism just happens to raise eyebrows over here.
why do you focus on racism ? when it was written, slavery was still going on in canada
but if someone they would say good for the s.o.b and you know it !
would be disrespect. but if they kill you for that, i will be there to support you
no u would not and u know it !
: angela merkel says shooting in france is not only attack on french citizens , but on freedoms of press
thats one major thing the terrorists have in common with the anglo american axis -free us political prisoners
solidarity with the victims in paris this attack is cruel and evil for sure i agree with terkel
something tells me the backlash will not be an expansion & amp ; militarization of press freedoms.
who gunmen jeffrey epstein also in car+trilateral commission
excuse my but that is some ‚Äú punk bitch shot ! ‚Äú
there is let is stop pretending we do not know it
france : since last night , gunfire and bombings have targeted two mosques , a prayer room , and a
i hope these attacks are also treated and described as acts of terrorism
bloody idiots. these poor people suffering a backlash by uneducated morons. please stay safe xx
it represented the psychological antidote to what terrorism tries to achieve
all it did was distract people from what the pertinent issues were, it was counter productive.
attacks ', as in the events being individually reported are only the tip of the iceberg.
they have the morons and the media to thank for the backlash !
stop talking about our country thanks because obviously you do not know anything.

all those peaceful quotes no longer apply because of the later violent text over ride them.

of course killing is neither required nor justifiable, but does this mean that keep on abusing prophets ?
where is it mentioned that he prophet muhammad peygamberallowed such use of his name ?

no i hold for these, they should have remained within civic limits. .

so why cartoons of the prophet muhammad peygamberfor sake of earning livelihood ?

government raises security alert to the highest level after deadly attack at magazine charlie held.
attack . i have just been asked by aljazeera if charliehebdo journalists should apologize ( for making fun at islamists
there is a good reason innocent aljazeera staff have been targeted in egypt-it is their employers.
fuck that no never ! fuck the islamist, speak your mind stay firm france !
i hope your response was suitably pithy.
it s going to end up in tears ....
a disgraceful way to put it & amp ; shows the failure of multiculturalism.
just to confirm what everyone already knows about al jazeera
adding insult to injury. having colleagues murdered is not ' penance ' enough, apparently.
why do you even need to ask ?
is going to apologize for the jihads terrorist who massacre muslims & amp ; nonbelievers every day ?
did not you know really ?
you understand does not apply to foreign owned / controlled media ? imbecile
after this horror the idea that charlie held should apologize for speaking its mind is obscene.
you should have said the survivors or the dead ? ‚Äú
are you stupid moron do you understand the 1st amendment ?
oh i i was just being sarcastic.
what a sick question hope you told him where to go.
is backing supremacist ?
of not. that question by aljazeera is disgusting
probably. they are based in qatar whose gov not funds terrorist groups around the world.
people gather for a minute is silence to remember the victims of the attack
cries every day. attacked by terrorists from israel. ur point being ?

french media calling attack the worst attack in france in decades
actually it is the deadliest attack since 1835.
too bad the terrified camera person did not have an ar instead of a camera.
38 killed in today due to terrorist attack. any news ? no com they were muslims
freedom of speech for some.
media calling attack the worst attack in france in decades
we are talking terror attacks in peace time.
if not when if not this, what ???
not in the worst since the 19th century
you do not have to care. terrorist have no religion do not be islamophobia. peace v
reports coming out from paris say the policeman murdered on the pavement was ahmed merabet . a french muslim .
terrorists killing do not suggest that it is muslims killing muslims.
these people do not discriminate between muslims/christians/piccaninnies - they know only hatred/evil deeds ...
why still consider themselves religious ? read here :
i wonder if that fact will cause the killers any regret üò•
just shows how ridiculous these killings are - they murder their own
we have no evidence the killers are psychopaths, in fact research would suggest it is unlikely x

a white blew up the federal building in ok that does not make all christians terrorists.
religious abuse twisting scriptures to justify evil. what if social media existed during kkk craziness ?
and thankfully the vast majority do not need to read anything to know building schools is a good idea
would you tweet the point ?
do you know every bad christian ?
the ones that build schools need to get control over the ones that blow up schools !
when are these good duran readers going to speak up publicly against these bad duran readers ?
incorrectly read the ‚Äú in the first instance
egyptian paper al masry al-youm has taken bold step of publishing some of charlie hebdo is controversial front covers :
some mg warriors should really remake that cartoon with cab instead.
none of is portrayals though.
all papers in the world should do precisely that, right away
to support or to incite ? amay refers to charliehebdo as the magazine that has repeatedly insulted our prophet
disposal of bold steps can not bring back outgoing.
is the true red line in egypt
there are laws against criticizing jews you know
media has lots of nutcases & amp ; others that freely express controversial opinions including army hawaii
not that and co would find anything objectionable about is stance on egypt ...
despite being vilified by all the progressives, egypt is showing us the way.
how edgy cartoons like these merely resemble what is already published in the egyptian press.
bold trying ‚Äú f ****** stupid ‚Äú

single finger raised by gunman looks like what isis fighters often do in battle . cc
people keep saying that but yet to show me data to back this claim !
in it is called tashahud, done by the second alma, but not by everyone/group/region.
there is no god but allah this is the right thing i guess
looks to be radical or no ?
you mean the news that have agendas ?
if you need data then you are deluded. these people are not civilized.
yet it is the wrong hand. significance of this ?
i m and never done this in my life so slowdown on your comment and analysis
not all are terrorists. but most terrorists are muslims.
common sense will tell you not all terrorist are muslims !

have you ever seen left hand used though ? i have not.
note the necessary corrections by air no2cc, sammy khakis & amp ; larry miller.
worth noting that it is a symbol of aphid that is widely employed. video is here :
not only even used in the saudi flag.
when i make claims i base it on facts not emotions like most people do !
the only agenda i see is to make europeans accept every other race and ideology.
yes
of course you do and no doubt backed up by mindless liberals with tinted specs.
flag has but no finger raised (d'be comical though)
single finger raised by right hand is used by all in prayer five times a day
i am right but wrong at the same time ?
you are right but all terrorists are muslim.
if you need evidence then you need read the news more often.
you are an irresponsible person.
not you obviously. it is good reporting. meant the attackers
ugh. media needs to report what they know. guessing achieves nothing.
based on shouting a few words ?
such gesture done when someone is watching or to a camera. i doubt it is the case.
i am afraid it certainly looks the case.
tell me this is not radical islamist !

cartoonists are often our dearest allies in fight 4 freedom of expression , and freedom in general . we mourn

every boy loves aster ix ! better than a history lesson.
bravo ... you are the best ... we have missed you.

politically correct stunted driven reflects your dwarf withered mind
we peter. but what do you think about that ?
yes. they can. its easy !
several groups have stated that gang violence rises due to gangsta rap too.
peter. what you wrote is true of critics of islam in general
he would have no problem with songs about killing homophones. i guarantee it.
placard was at rally against islamist fanatics, not against muslims in general
i am flattered by your offer, but you are not my type. sorry mate.
in bigoted harassed peter for gay rights walk.
has also persistently campaigned to ban homophobic reggae music.
rights groups confirm rise in anti-gay attacks after release of ' kill gays ' songs
. still waiting for your reply. you support the murderers ' action, yes or no ?
not peter - your choice of words highlights part of the cause
under v. the mere advocacy of violence is free speech.
the truth is not - and the journey to it should be encouraged
i it is only incitement when a satirist or non-lefty says it, right ?
direct incitement would be the us standard of imminent lawless action.
. did tell mama report ?
that vile cartoon was grossly offensive.
i know hence the
call for death to gays way more than any nazis do.
kill cartoonists blame islam - islamaphobic
is that why you say islamism rather than simply islam ? fear of murder ?
amp they hate gays too !!!
speaking of 1st amendment protects right to preach jihad.
why not do cartoons offend you ?
thank you. i do my bit, as do many others. best wishes
and if our and others speak with truth and honesty then .... & gt ;
i agree that it is winning - appeasement is an example - but there are signs such as etc
including turkey and n -
people like never consider that censorship they advocate could be used against them.
freedom of speech is not outcome-dependent. speech can not make people do anything.
if social media posts harass or threaten violence against muslims, they should be removed. they are crimes
peter sticks his head above the parapet in public. he is a very brave man.
only you will know but i suspect your liberalism trumps your honesty
bible amp call for death to gays. should we ban them ?
encouraging the prosecution of music for ‚Äú inciting violence ‚Äú is a very dangerous slippery slope.
no in for first time in 2,000 yrs - jewish and christian populations declining throughout region
peter supports final mutual. tell mama, faith matters - and their dodgy blasphemy doublespeak.
i have been campaigning against islamism for 20 years. i never saw my critics challenge qaradawi etc
but question is how long this inhuman act will go on and we all will be tolerating.
we‚Äôve known that for peter, surely.
please email me examples with links. thanks
at least 12 killed in shooting at office of french satirical : charlie held
let peter declare ' nazis ' in cairo. test tolerance.
sad thing in general would condemn u for being gay
you are using the same logic as people who blame heavy metal and hip-hop for murder.
terror is and will win, in my view.
bigots hide behind their 2justify their hatred
. said he is not against muslims in general.
. why do you hate freedom of speech ?
you can challenge and debate but you can not be grossly offensive like the paper
and its only now that you are realizing this ??
if someone thinks gays should die, i want them ...
if reggae can incite violence ‚Äú, then so can just about any gangsta rap song.
did not you also campaign for p.i.e ?...
welcome to the real world mitchell !
... to make those views known so the public knows who to avoid.
much of that is old. has changed considerably in the last year.
exactly. we need to know who the enemy is.
they shouted and the prophet has been avenged - seems you are playing smoke and mirrors
what do you mean now ‚Äú ? it was and is ever thus
they are different. is a religion. islamism is a political ideology that wants a religious dictatorship
cartoons are said to cause violence too. argument can be used to censor anything.
how can a cartoon offend ‚Äú an adult ?
hoping every newspaper in the world publishes 1 of those cartoons on their front page tomorrow.
i can think of numerous songs that directly encourage the killing of cops.
possible their attempts to slander and vilify have proven inadequate -
satire is not hatred. learn the difference !
. you sound like you support the murderers actions.
well haters gonna get hate. oh and fuck you !
advocating violence is a serious criminal offense in the uk and most countries.
absurdly , i am told this is not time to talk about reforming muslim attitudes to " blasphemy " .
answer my question. have you been anywhere in nigeria apart from ikoyi ? ignorant buffoon
speaking out in support of satire is something that should be spoken about when satirists are killed by all
when toy island happened you were busy telling everyone it was definitely ‚Äú western civilization ‚Äú ? hypocrit.
what pray tell i am listening
i grew up in work in ikoyi. so what ?
kill everyone for their cause. isis also kills muslims. that is what allah commanded.
that poorhouse is nice hotel. over priced though.
you are obviously more illiterate than i thought. got to love these folk
ever been to i have.
for someone big on rationality you do seem to be beholden to your cognitive reactions.
no but your questions are those of someone who has not read anything of note past highchair
this is the kind of attitude from you that moderate democracy loving muslims like do not understand
i doubt you have the time to consider the state of post biafran nigeria.
read it duh clearly give account they were islamist shout god is great in arabic
have you done any science. or social science ? i am assuming you are a graduate
is the intellectual home of sociology. how about we actually apply some ?
yeah. well i used to chill on ikoyi. aand you son should pay more attention on class
allegedly one of the policemen confronting them was also muslim. what does that do for your narrative ?
here ya go read on bbc
or are you in favor of weaponising grief ?
you say they as if it is one set of dudes in bond lair somewhere.
fascism is nothing fascists existed throughout history, religion is the best tool
no speculation. they shouted allah akbar ‚Äú. the uncensored videos are here :
modern did you forget the dark ages ?
planet fear of criticizing islam. or, put differently, planet dhimmitude.
how can you still doubt that ? this is fucking incredible
they are if worshiping pagans man
they are a modern phenomenon. part of the reaction to modernity.
what about he killed muslims for apostasy and called moderate muslims hypocrites.
fallacious. speaking out against murder is not the same as attributing self serving narratives.
you seem to have bought knowledge from the traffic jam book sellers. go away dude.
not you wish to go after muslims. you nick kind of gives it away.
that mister is not speculation. its fact.
you are just trying to procrastinate the inevitable. it is the humiliation that is gonna hit the apologists
what has the delta militants got to do with book harm. diverging eh ?
and they were and ?
what about the insurgents in the delta ?
buddy. do not educate me on history when you are unaware of the epistemology of current movements
the apologists will blame this either on jews or on american foreign policy and drones
have you heard of the jidda wars ?
when rifting still called them germans. why so hard to say jihads are muslim
even if u were serious conversing on twitter about narratives, social construction and identity is not possible
is a modern phenomenon though as is the revisionism of some of these groups
or in the vernacular do one.
i wish to go after the underlying cause aka the depiction of muhammad etc as justification to kill
and this is why i do not take self-declared free thinkers and ‚Äú rationalists ‚Äú seriously
we have bigger priorities. a rocket scientist wore a shirt that is an outrage.
insurgencies fueled by different undertones. big difference
which version of the is that in ? are you repeating the stuff off answering islam ?
its a new report. so ?
goat i am in tell me what i do not know
ever heard of book harm ? they are muslims who kill muslims
do not be an idiot.
fascism is early 20th c political movement
considering the state of book harm have many factors to them.
now you are just using hyperbole & amp ; rhetoric
do not like it block. add something useful or be silent
its a revisionist movement to some extent. began late 19th and early 2pth century
hackers supporting isis hacking french websites and putting up anti-charlie hebdo messages
and achieved what by this ?
should we all feeds with gay pron and images of muhammad ?
nothing about this humorous. you seem to be missing that point
defacing a website is not terrorism and does not kill anyone. it is just damn annoying.
i am talking about tracing back the source of computer hacking attributed to isis, not terrorism.
' apparently ' is an important caution when assessing such claims
that is a fucking fake tv show ... what are you saying ?!
as they say on who is got the best kung-fu ?
it does sound amusing to try to out-hack a hacker who has been supporting murderous ideology.
your priorities are righteous. you win lisa. have a good day

sad cartoon but better than to insult a religion.

u drew now ... now they have to bomb u.
not any religion. islam is more than religion. evil.
if your argument involves silencing critics by murdering them , then you have irretrievably lost the argument .
what kind of critics how do you define critic and insult ?
degrading is not the argument !
very well said ..... x

the statement says they attacked because cartoons of baghdad were published not our holy prophet
a sensitive topic under debate
you should have been after ch hate speech like you are after this all masked mullah.
your statement is factually incorrect.
just done arguing with so called educated guy on my status where he was defending charlie killings
these cartoons are poignant tributes to victims of the charlie hebdo attack

islam is not religion of peace‚úåÔ∏èit is theory of conquest that seeks domination by any means-ali
does not sound like you guys are in touch with reality much
o. will not let that happen
you must cot the wright source like obama said so, benjamin nitniyahu, david cameroon. etc.
even then comparing the 2 are mid-evil the muslims committed more atrocities than the christians did
speaking of air gt ;
have u read the'an and the haddiths ?
enjoy your delusions.
you just contradicted my point is islam is not bad bc of a group of extremists.
also kick out the united nations
if u have not u shut b4 making assumptions & amp ; comparing apples & amp ; oranges
my other point is that islam is not peaceful, proof is in their own text
most peaceful text were abrogated by later revelations
are you sure about that or is that what you want to believe
sell the property in nyc to donald trump for $1. 00 develop into something useful.
i if you will
still less live in west. it will not change anything
someone pass a note letting him know islam is not peaceful
so u shut compare relevant examples cut in the 7th century mohammad did claim islam was peaceful
if this cartoon is why staff have been shot at , all publications should show solidarity and republish

doubt it was this. published too soon for such a well coordinated raid to be planned.
i thought exactly the same. spread it !
i believe that it is because of this one

i do not want attention !! ‚Äù i can not tell ...
facts say otherwise ... real facts.
that was a weak wonder if he actually said that or an aid tweeted it.
maybe should have kept on driving ... shrugs.
i do not want attention !!
everything is not about black people you ignorant fuck
and his visit to the embassy today too ?
i was referring to the written statement, not the investigation.
why is it that you as a black man take issue with accepting the consequences of your actions ?
who did rayon provoke ?
ha fat comma is the only hoe
mike brown provoked the store owner and the cop he tried to kill.
... sh (lost soul)
have u released a statement ...?? smh
martin attacked that is a fact that anyone who paid attention knows.
.... ... lost frontal lobe ... aka : liberal
. perpetuating myths about what obama said to support the secret muslim myth, how original
... ferguson though
yea keep driving and ignore the guy acting suspicious who was on drugs and out of place.
differently. you try to turn it into a race issue which just makes you the racist.
like said. you do not care about black lives. you just hate white people
as late as this guy is, he is probably just now flying to surgeon to protest.
really you want to call me out on a fat finger from a cell phone ?
accurate there is concrete evidence that answers both of your questions !
otherwise you are gonna end up in a body bag for thinking you are badder than you really are
they absolutely did provoke. what world does this dip shit live in ?
the 911 operator told him not to ... check the facts.
wrong. try again. speech.
given that you rewrite facts that seems to make sense.
if you attack a man with a gun you are a dumb ass. period.
try again. he gives a list of ppm, incl christians, that should not be discriminated against
who the hell is rayon martin ? maybe he should not have slammed a guys head into concrete ?
garner did not provoke. mike brown sure as hell did
police did not tell him not to. see ... facts buddy. they are important.
even when the police tells u not to ... u follow anyway ... low ...
and while i wait for the first answer that will never come ... who did mike brown provoke ?
why would he fund ... oh never mind ... u us want attention ...
maybe it was gossip or sandra rose ? class a journalism there ! lmao !!!!
extremist love they are suffering from liberals like you ...
wonder why you are so busy sucking in everything that sniveling lowlife said ? even obvious lies.

why has daily telegraph pixelated this charlie hebdo cover ? shameful
will other papers do same ? mt : why has pix elated this cover ? shameful
you will notice that perhaps surprisingly the guardian has shown solidarity and published a picture of the mag cover
who else even dared to show it ?
they moderated a remark about suffers as well. the establishment thinks ignoring things makes social solutions.
i am not but is not it the law in the uk ?
pathetic cowards. apologists for terror. soon to be united caliphate instead of united kingdom
because they are afraid. this is the real islamophobia.
if the press in had any balls they would all print it large on front page

as we watch the horror of the terror attacks in paris , consider this : our president continues to release
thought you were going to say ferguson. there is a common thread.
better a thousand journalists die than one terrorist get water on his face ... or something.
our president does not get it, for that matter neither does the legislature. ban islam from u.s.
and what is he sgt ; muslim !!!!
actually they are legal detainees but needed to release my brethren to cause havoc upon the world
would be horrible if it was one of the released/reformed prisoners.
is waiting for them with open arms and a neck to die for !
yes that is what u r !
he is really supporting the wrong side, huh ?
you r so wrong i can not even laugh. damn u stopped me from laughing !
and this , if you are not saturated :
a perspective i wholeheartedly support and is completely right.
so showing compassion to these people means i feel none for others ? grow up.
... and even if you are.
i would say some over saturation is warranted.
i do not think i could be saturated i am so fucking annoyed.
as a muslim , i condemn the cruel attack on & amp ; offer condolences to the french people .
you have no idea about how good it is to read statements like yours !
like i said in the end all of us will be judge
i think you are very wrong.
yeah right what they filled pockets with oil and went home ? idiot !
why did all the white british people apologized for their murderous 400 yrs occupation of india ??
r lot of 72 sects to b specific.
fed up ... stop !
but are there different islams ‚Äú ? or is it all one ?
look why do you care huh this is our belief as islams why do you care huh
day we trying to help themselves by looting oil for their consumerist countrymen.
be false flag operation like 911 2 attack muslim lands+character assassinate islam+muslims 4 oil+israel
i am justifying action at painting1. 6 in wit d same brush is oversimplification n moronic
they were trying to help ? trying to free women from oppression. and a murderous regime.
that can is we should not conclude before investigation,
good way of getting over the 140 character limit ! 2 pages of my own here .....
why do you we never bother with any of your belief publicly but you bother us.
i die as and i will always hold strong and pure as an islams
i did not feel obliged to say. i just wanted to say.
good. if only all could ignore vast passages of their own book like yourself
n those bad ones will be judged in the end
i would have a huge impact on the moderates, this action would change them.
yeah u r right guru. keep hating. dat would give u lot of inner peace.
because you conveniently reject the violence in islamic scripture. these men do not.
you now nothing about the prophet himself so shut up
alright. so did all d yankees apologized for their 10 yrs murderous war in iraq or afghanistan ?
was a killer and a pedro as are his followers. cult of evil !!!!
at its core is evil violent and encourages pedro behavior. u know that ! pure evil

but why are not women given the same privilege ? why are men allowed in the first place ?
oh you would not now here is someone who would not stand up to tyranny ...
blasphemy amp apostasy are grave crimes & amp ; they deserve serious punishments
i would if u do not insult them (nazis) .
but can you please answer me ? i do not want to burn in hell.
what is a vocal ex-muslim atheist we need many more like him
you handled that with more grace than i could have. bravo to you.
then follow u feel is better.
indeed i am a muslim hence privileged.
but why should my 1st wife take responsibility if 3 other wives children either ?
he is not defending islam
we are allowed to insult nazism but not islam ? no special privileges !
that is what they deserve.
. what part of he‚Äôs an atheist ‚Äù are you struggling with ?
if you insult me and i punch you, who is to blame ?
are you for real it is not an insult.
. nobody was killed until they insulted our faith.
but do not you ask such a question to people who told you to follow allah ?
someone clearly does not follow you.
you are an utter part of a separate problem we need to eradicate.

updated : here‚Äôs what we know about the gunmen behind the charlie hebdo attack
the two wanted men are suspects who have not been charged. just saying.
how do we know this much about them ? are these mugshots ?

i suspect that number is lower than it should be sadly.

freedom of speech is one thing to incite a barbarian is another.

this cartoon by robert mankoff from the new yorker sept 2012 .
. i was not contesting that. it was the reference to political correctness i was questioning.
as a white person i feel deeply offended by this cartoon !
not sure i understand the question ?
sorry you do not seem to get the point of ' cartoon
i think the notion that thoughts can be made unthinkable by modifying language is lacking in credibility
that is a euphemism. completely different thing.
so new speak is dodgy ?
they appear to have been concerned about being insulted. i take your point, however.
can you explain why i should not be ?
you misunderstand this terrible murder apparently happened because people can not face satire.
as a smear is how the right attacks human rights & amp ; equality. similar to.

this cartoon by robert mankoff from the new worker sept 2012. ‚Äù
there is everything wrong with being pc, it is brainwashing of the worst kind.
why is that an accident ?
the problem is you can be proud of who you are unless you are a straight white man
satire is truly dead. did they even look at the cartoon.
you disgust me. how can this be your priority when people are dying over a cartoon !
then i stand with orwell on that then.
i appreciate your apology it is sometimes hard to recognize satire
tried you appear to be impervious.
there is that word again ‚Äú offended ‚Äú again, do you use it to describe everything ?
two completely different kinds of euphemism, i think you mean.
why is it so white ? seems racist.
. nice. are you opposed to religious freedom then ?
i drew you a picture. correct text together with.
why are you attacking the inuit way of life like this !?!?!! * runs out of exclamation marks *

oh i am sorry i thought you were capable of an adult discussion, my bad.
i am sorry if you still do not get it.
i hope you see my earlier posting about in a different light as what it was : satire
be proud of who you are
being politically correct is to pretend to live in a world that does not should focus on url ?
everyone is gender and ethnicity is an accident. did you decide to be a white man ?

same need some sleep now.
as many as i need to. how many times are you gonna mention this non-existent soul ?
i know a lot already from this conversation, but what prevents you of stopping ?
you are still the only one calling what they did ‚Äú bullying ‚Äú
so should a bully have a right to bully his class mate, because of ?
sure i but also a philosopher. it was poorly expressed earlier.
and according to the yes.
when you learn to use these in practice, you will enjoy your life more.
there is no business and there are no classes.
gt but it is ok, we now know you have double standards.
unless ask and are belief systems, i do not see the comparison.
stop with the condescending bull shit. you know nothing of me or what i enjoy.
it no doubt about that, and do not worry my little friend
gagged and are two different things. again and still.
i do not see the point in your faulty ‚Äú school ground bullying ‚Äú analogy.
i just point them out, do not go shooting people.
but will have to pay it for society, and anyway for his/hers maker and.
he is much worse than a douche bag.
that is for the umpteenth time, it is a b-a-d a-n-a-l-o-g-y
maybe which is stupid, from.
well that is your and your still in far minority with that ‚Äú belief ‚Äú.
then your answer was absurd.
was a pedophile. says so in the duran. ‚Äú did nothing wrong ‚Äú hahn
only one i have seen so far.
so the law is stupid ? should it be replaced with sharia ?
you forgot the concept sincerity ‚Äú. must be difficult.
why would i be that interested what the bible says ?
yes i see the repetition. unfortunately for you, the law agrees with me. thankfully.
i can use water for them.
everyones beliefs and the main religions central path, are again those famous
that is not that is wrong, and can be ridiculed.
have could i prove you that love, other emotions or for example mind exists ?
discriminate do you mean cherry pick ?
we will end up with this.
and once saying about an issue, or meaningfully insulting about something, are different things.
how many times you want to repeat that low-level belief of yours ?
there is nothing to understand. just unsubstantiated claims.
that is again your can you see there is starting to be repetition pattern here ?
it was still completely tasteless and stupid. now they are dead.
so we can bully our class mates now ?
not to me. like i said, people deserve respect, ideas do not.
the limits are set by the common sense of the wise.
so what is the con then ???
did i say they did ?
but the was not written by, if you can recall a bit backwards.
another general knowledge tidbit ‚Äú. i am starting to enjoy them.
there are scales and limits. crossed many, but of course does not justify killings.
and who is the one deciding what is offense and what freedom if speech, you ?
if it truly was a would not their extremists be extremely peaceful ?
but for someone to whom nothing is sacred, this might be too difficult to understand.
did not did not write.
no one should be silenced in case they might hurt someones ‚Äú important sacred ‚Äú thingies.
i understood perfectly. thanks.
i know. but does not make much difference which profession/religion he/she has in this case.
disrespect of an a belief. there is a huge difference with disrespecting humans.
prove to me a soul exists. gibberish.
you must be good. now there is some sarcasm for you
so that is common sense ‚Äú as you define it. riiiiight
you mean people like this ?
sure. on the other i am also right.
so do not ridicule ridicule bible.
you are the only one claiming the cartoons were ‚Äú bullying ‚Äú. they are not.
you are confusing freedom of speech with freedom to offend what to others is inviolable or sacrosanct.
so if a bully bullies also others, anyone should not feel offended ?
nothing sacred to but you fail to understand, that lots of sacred to some others.
never said they are. people deserve to respect. myths, fables and imaginary beings do not.
really i am the only one ?
there should be limits to things, but not free speech.
in the civilized world can you show me some statistics ?
i disagree. and thank so does most of the civilized world.
these things are international and crossing borders anyway. they are actually, but let is stick to earth
do not hence the word ‚Äú if ‚Äú.
is this soul business something they tell you in these ‚Äú spirit ‚Äú classes ?
first one i have talked to. why the sarcasm ? it makes you look weak.
and what it came to some of the worst ones : extremely insulting and obscenely ugly.
of who would blindly accept anything, especially dogmas.
so you are a comedian.
rudeness is weak mans imitation of strength.
there is no point in your bully nonsense. it is a bad analogy. you bully.
if they had been satirizing only islam/muslims, i would kinda see your point.
thinking is no means of knowing the absolute truth ‚Äú
in this case because of. holy war actually means war against the enemies of ones.
but these artists ‚Äú at, did much worse things without any taste or limits.
why you are asking ?
aggression problem that is quite an understatement, but yes, yes there is.
there is probably leafs or someones shirt nearby for help.
did i ever it would give ? are you focusing at all, or maybe drunk ?
i wonder who is doing this and if the people in the market drew a picture ?
no i did you just will not get it.
you should stop with this analogy. it makes no sense.
not many good though some nice guidelines if one can discriminate.
no it does it is a ‚Äú freedom of speech ‚Äú, according to -people.
i in my next tweet. besides i am still laughing at this gem
but will you be able to answer this, or ?
he unfortunately. bullying should not be accepted in the name of freedom of speech.
repeating myself you keep bringing up this non-existent ‚Äú soul ‚Äú.
i you do not want to disrespect my beliefs do you ?
gt should not be considered ‚Äú sacred ‚Äú anymore.
some douches bag might have laughed, does not make the pictures right then again.
you are confusing freedom of speech with freedom to offend
show me a law that says they crossed a limit.
but it is wrong. why would it ought to be ?
bed time for me. will return. bye for now.
i will finish with these quotes from the very smart have a good one.
if the actions of the cartoonists were lawful (and they were) , - sgt ;
not sure what you mean here, please explain, got curious.
you got to use the word ‚Äú bully ‚Äú twice in this tweet.
it is everybody lost.
that is your for which you have freedom, though it might be silly.
if the police is not going to paradise.
if you broke a yes. i would not argue your right to say it though.
agreed. much worse than anything anyone ever drew on paper. yet he/she can express her/his feelings.
no you are not ! hmmm, maybe you are a comedian after all.
you real continue even with this ?
do not agree. the limits set by islam ? france is not an islamic country.
more of this soul ‚Äú thing, huh ?
if you do not know, now you know
people deserve belief does not.
so people can stop calling it a. thanks, i will tell them.
by the that is a police officer they are executing. and a muslim.
correct. bullying should not be approved in the name of freedom of speech. did wrong too.
pointing out those is naturally ok. involving obscene blasphemy and grossness, is not.
i guess i am amp ; com i see the world as it is.
so should one be able to bully as much as one wants in school, because of ?

that is letting her off way too easy !
now you know i can not rt that !
logic camp policy ‚Äú : said this awhile back. unbelievably ignorant. ‚Äù
. rule never bring a whistle to a gun fight !
it is speculative , but judging by video & amp ; imagery from scene of attack , these gunmen are
amateurs do not have a rpm.
its also strategy wants coalition boots on the ground in theater this is provocation
let is not speculate just yet. before we know it, everyone is pointing fingers.
sure they are probably re imported fm isis. as many other in eu
they are trained it is obvious.
looks like one shooter lost his sneaker, then calmly picked it up after the firefight.
how they fired at the policeman while running down was extremely professional sickening though
just want to express appreciation for your consistent caution in making claims. so unusual these days !
by who also in car+trilateral commission
oh first class speculation on the video you keep circulating, well done.
very much so. trained terrorists, absolutely !
most probably trained in the west-sponsored killing fields of syria. talk at chickens coming home ...
" not afraid " - thousands in france gather to a send message after charlie hebdo attack .
they always thought freedom was more important and they always stood for it through their cartoons

rt not afraid -thousands in france gather to a send message after charlie held attack.
who is the cartoonist ? anonymous ?
they were called when the attack started
rip char bonnier- igneous- honor- maris- carat- brinsolare- our rad- megabit- rousseau- renamed
that can not happen ... they were and always will be the faces of charlie held !
i grew up with cartoons of or ..... they were targeted many times but never gave up !
where any of the actual cartoonists hurt or only the staff of the paper ?
not as important as apparently.
may the force be with you. always.
no it s a satirical newspaper. very famous for its cartoons
are probably newspapers assuming there are such things.
yes but who was the cartoonist ? so he can be honored.
a great one ...... not the same enemies at that time
they stood for decency and against christian, jewish and muslim zealotry.
another one was finally memorialized by the masterpiece underworld.
the cartoonists are very famous ones. their names belongs to their newspaper. not forgetting the cops too
all those talented and great people contribute to make the world a better place ...

re : charlie hebdo seriously . if your god & amp ; /or prophet needs armed men to protect him
add to that that his followers are pathologically ignorant.
love it. stealing it

the shooting is an act of terror - violence with a political motive - but well within our existing threat
us and call peaceful protest low level terrorism.

very difficult to have faith in something that changes to suit the times and the ignorant
you better check with the bbc on your choice of words ...
good to know. . but is there anything conceivable outside the post-9/12 threat assessment ?
we do not need to change our current approach to combating violent political extremism.

because school bullying and rampant murdering are totally the same ...
you do not appease bullies you defeat them.
so he would not be offended by stopping him ?
would be nice but that is not how it works in the school systems in texas.
the should immediately check all supporters. might be another terrorist.
documented false flag shooter secret service intelligence
so true. and leftist support belies the idea that these people are not extremist
you just went off the deep end
i my examples i was saying the skinny wimpy kids were the ones annoying the bully(muslims with guns)

are you unfamiliar with the term attack ? journo :
still does not denigrate esp. since islam does not advocate such criminal stupidity.
sure but will probably never be able to proof who is real behind it ... as usual

well yea those are found in the constitutional amendments. he had those removed a long time ago ...

. yep. interesting how it is only the islamist that massacre their cartoonists and journalists.
talking about what van goth said, not why he was killed
your relativism is disturbing. 24000 islamic terrorist attacks since 9/11 and you talk about 2000 years ago.
rt remember that criticized all religions and people, not just and !
i said religion not these few follow the real teaching of islam.
for it is that is the big threat, for liberal democrats it is islamism.
scientists let the evidence of results win any argument, not who is the best lair or beheaded.
but the only peaceful religion ‚Äú reacted !!!!
but which religion were they killed for criticizing ? have not seen any christian beheading lately.

cartoon by australian artist - " can not sleep , thoughts with my french cartooning colleagues "
it is brilliant and extremely moving.
showing solidarity with the victims is necessary , but not enough . we must insist to coexist , and reject
stop is spelled s t o p and not r e j e c t
not all are. some are purely economic migrants, and a few political refugees.
we would never coexist with intolerance you fool
agreed. we must also try to integrate those who want to be integrated.
good that are speaking out against this sir. i pity the that cannot separate from fiction.
the teachings of all prophets who possessed the priesthood that preceded mohammad (who held no priesthood) .
salman rushdie : " i stand with , as we all must , to defend the art of satire ,
u can not hurt peoples sentiments n keep on doing so ... it makes these things inevitable.
is respectable my are !
hurt feelings mass murder ... ladies and gents : the religion of peace has spoken.
it most certainly is freedom of expression.
i would go so far as protesting satire is what is objectionable. freedom confuses you.
if a religious personality is respect is shaken by a cartoon, how he cud b respectable
are you justifying the killings as a valid means of protest when peaceful methods fail ?
it is highly objectionable amp ; against islamic teachings. earlier muslims protested peacefully.
you can. or you can shut up and let intellectuals like abe bar al-baghdadi take or
much like your comments are offending me
hi you can find across the world global liberty news from hope you will like.
so let them make some cartoons ... protest again ... can not say anyone will care tho
bullshit. your prophet killed poets & amp ; those who mocked him.
wrong. a person is reaction of violence to hurt sentiment is their choice.
is right. rose is right. stephane char bonnier was right.
you do not seem to understand that people are allowed not to care about what you think
if your religion can not take satire it must be a weak religion.
yes no right thinking person justify killing people but all must restrained 2 avoid further enmity.
right. war is peace. = 5. you would put everyone in room 101.
what the boy lip statutory rapist and warlord is a respectable religious personality ?
bit worrying you do not seem to know what freedom of expression is, insulting and mocking is
it is actually exactly an expression of freedom.
. mass murder is an inevitable result of hurt feelings ? fuck that.
the right of freedom of expression includes the right to offend !
then you do not understand freedom of speech. not one bit.
no they did not. pick up a history book please !
how dare you put your beliefs above everyone else is. afasik, beliefs are not fact.
how come hr organisations in the west give awards to supporter of such actions as who was awarded by karama
this means that there is a deficiency in the organization that give him the award,
this is evidence that there is an agreement between them
it is seems like bin laden and isis are the new generations of representatives !!
is this not an indication of the lack of credibility of these organizations or they sponsor of terrorism ?
such these mistake it considered as internal weakness, which unacceptable to comes out from organization like

the pen is mightier than the sword.
dates back to the 50 is, and has been taking on mostly everyone with power no till today
yes but the anti (among st others) stance took by is what prompted the attacks
a extremist assassin is not automatically a representative of muslims, or of their prophet ‚Ä¶
is anti any religious system of beliefs and politically atheist/ left wing ; this sparked some fundamentalists.
i am not sure their respective journalistic levels are quite the same though ‚Äì just a hunch ‚Ä¶

those who died at will live forever , because pens are more powerful than guns . do not ever let
obviously your insults do not debunk my statements, nor justify lazy generalizations.
you are equating the extremists with an entire religion. that is wrong.
i think that you need to really look at the global aims of islam.
you are creating a monolithic straw man. for example, al-azhar has condemned attack.
condemn extremists but do not casually condemn a very broad and large religion.
your an educated woman. most islamic states would never have permitted you an education. think !
totally yes. that is why i am weary of a religion that is only interested in dominating
and you are simpering whilst delightful just makes you look wet and invective
trouble is low information ppm can not make distinctions because that requires thought and even study.
how do you defend a group that support slavery, subjugation of women and death to non-muslim
do you support the subjugation of women and the desire to kill or convert all non muslims ?
i condemn criminal human rights abuses & amp ; sweeping generalizations.
when you realism just how 2nd class and worthless you are as a non muslim then make comments
before demanding where is the condemnation ? ‚Äú check if it is not there already.
trivial to find condemning extremists, but you overlook this.
no i am just amazed that so many are sleepwalking into the islamification of europe.
logic has poor record so far
logic will cure religion in the ass
so you do condemn thank you and good night.
at the time of the crusades they were supported by the entire christian world. your point is ?
surely the vast majority of muslim condemn such events anyway e.g.
not according to my local parish priest.
history will show people like you as the apologists that permitted genocide
not sure. if train needs to pay more attention.
my point is that a large religion is supporting extremists and needs to give them up.
whilst many imams preach hatred and support for 9/11 and 7/7 i will demand condemnation. ok ?
do you really not see that ‚Äú peaceful islam ‚Äú is enabling islamic terrorists ? wake up !
extremists are not it is irresponsible of you to conflate the two. think !
if the religion supports the extremists and the evidence shows it does then no i am not.
i suggest you go and live somewhere that sharia law is practiced for a while.
try reading some they have no space for multiculturalism.
but back on point do you support slavery and child sex like islam does ?
. those people are fighting a rear guard action against the continued if halting progress of our species.
let is stay on topic. you were making sweeping statements about a broad religion.
take your lazy soft wet liberal views and ram them up your rectum.
i can only applaud the muslim funeral directors of australia for their stance.
. afraid coffee drinker that is as misleading as blaming every christian for crusades of for troubles

in response to the massacre we must not suppress liberties in the name of defending them - that‚Äôs what the
.... which is objectively wrong across the board, religious or not.
they are not terrorists. they are murderers.
religious liberty is unnecessary and regressive. all should conform to standards on gender/sexuality/freedom or be gone
it is also what governments want.
someone who opposes handing away their countries on a plate to foreigners and respect their european heritage.
strange lefties are always trying to stop patriotic europeans from saying what they think.
unless you think the borders of europe extend to iraq.

want to provoke us into repressive reaction, to undermine democracy which they loathe
am perfectly happy to stand corrected if the above could be demonstrated
peter just did - ‚Äú that is what the terrorists want ‚Äú
what liberties are being called for surprising ? or, are you preempting politicians curtailing our liberties ?
considering the i took the liberty to be freedom of speech. i may be wrong
gender polygamy, genital mutilation, rape, repression, murder
perhaps for simpletons i will use the old fashioned term for europe - christendom.
yes. and so we should.
its also what the establishment wants. i wonder where these terrorists get the money from ?
is a patriotic ?
not quite that explicit security agencies often quote the threat of homegrown terrorists all the time
our record of suppressing civil liberties in response to past terrorist acts does not fill me with hope.
so turkey is in then.
96 of the land mass of turkey is classed as asia !

oops you missed it. i asked if you supported lampooning the prophet and not expect retribution.
so this mean you are a moron ?
is it okay to lampoon the prophet without retribution ? do you approve of it ?
as a matter of fact it is not immutable. much of it is interpreted in various ways.
this thought you express here is incompatible with the tenets of islam
is it okay to assassinate for a draw ? in france we have a ‚Äú judiciary system ‚Äú.

look at this filthy murderous religion too, fucking christians
their power is significant diminished today because they started a war with uganda

french cartoonist charb among dead in attack , his cartoons often attacked racism and islamophobia .
the fool defends his enemies and persecutes his allies. lesson learned yet europe ?
people should not live in fear for stating their point of view ! cowards !
blessings to his and the families of others who were killed.
religion should be just like large sized soft drinks.
he was on the wrong side of the barricade, killed by those who protected.
how to be killed by islamic terrorists then. if the initial rumors are three.
at least 12 killed in shooting at office of french satirical : charlie held
go ride with them.
poor attempt by to justify attack , despite the fact that france was first to recognise palestine
banned protests they were violent and muslims had damaged their public property there ...
this observation is full of stupidity as pro pelistenian demonstration and vandalism in france was a stupid action.
controversial tweets can help to become a celebrity ... dear bark ha this a cheap idea
has to say of where is religion of state & amp ; a to tame others ?
i mean how disgusting can this get ! as pigs will all
this has dad and iraqi mother.
was the first to recognize palestine as a state.
; you still believe in who has worked with ? hypocrisy lies there.
even if banned any demonstrations, will it justify massacre of innocents. apologists shut up pl
defy protest ban in paris ‚Äú - see pics n get some not cheat
idiots like have no sense of knowledge, masquerading as intellectuals
so is justifying killings at for not allowing demonstrations in support of a third country.
instead of focusing on the recent dead in paris , we should keep in mind that islamists have committed 24,784
why are you calling them ' islamist ' instead of muslims ?
. it‚Äôs not instead ‚Äù. it‚Äôs not a case of one or the other.
all the while people excuse atrocities because they are not `true muslims` this evil will continue.
more every is a potential ‚Äú islamist ‚Äú.

killing innocent people in the name of islam is much , much more offensive to me than any cartoon can
is upsetting the psychology of muslim youth ; muslims, pl wake up at least now !!
if they mock do they deserve the urania punishment of death ?
how can killing innocent children or sexually exploiting them make way for janna ? is this jihad ?
how can killing innocent kurd, christian, ship, hazard, ahmediya sendyouto heaven ?

killing people in the name of religion is offensive to me.
in fact infringement of their right of religion. but i fully condemned killing this people

salman rushdie defends charlie hebdo , calls for " fearless disrespect " of all religions
tolerance of religion has failed ! religion deserves nothing but ridicule.
that is demonstrably not read a history book. name me a society without religion.
tolerance did not work. religion must go !
that is a pretty absurd position considering that most of the world is ‚Äú religious. ‚Äú
religion is in itself absurd. not compatible with society.
fearless disrespect ............ brilliant ! what would we do without such wisdom
this seems very irresponsible to me. antagonism gets us nowhere.
okay ... and walks away)
is not fearlessness. it is the root of intellectual self-sabotage & amp ; extremism.

disrespecting beliefs is not living or dying on your foot.
not. help change the world. not spread ignorance
that is a quote from albert camus.
no u go and see the difference between criticism and bullying üòÇüòÇ
girl is fat ' is criticism btw. you are criticizing her weight.
but only got offended. and even now some of them are trying to defend terrorists.
thanks for pointing it out. it is a quote i have remembered for more than 30 years.
12 go and celebrate. what a cunt.
he probably got it from zapata
in some cultures saying that girls is fat is a compliment. whatever they criticized every religion+
exactly and she has guts to justify !! how long will people be so blinded.
you believe in gods. that makes you a fool.
you people died and you are still trying to find middle ground.
i know i am not evil at all so yeah üòä
then they are pathetic who lack islam. and i got offended by shooting more than the cartoon
do not. have a nice day tho
interesting that had used it and nothing i see makes the connection.
are you serious you just gave excuse for bullying in name of criticism ! jesus. bye.
cause no i just saw today.
i was not but whatever dude be u and i be me ‚úå
i hate ppm like u who claim to be humanist when u r racist af
does it matter i am a regular human being
i grew up listening to this all my life and emilia zapata was known for this.
how is making fun of my prophet a freedom speech ? u disgust me.
you have no tolerance for bullying but killing people in name of belief is okay ?
the same that raped his 9yo wife ? you follow him ?
interesting. lots of references to camus, since it was in his book.
shutting up your mouth in fear of terrorists is living on your knees.
of course it is - no belief is beyond ridicule - esp religious fairy tales.
it is offensive when you are brainwashed and you do not know the meaning of satire.
said it during the mexican revolution there is more on it search it.
yeah it causes 0 harm. whatever, even it causes, it is f*king free speech.
i told u i belong to no sect, in a humanist above all
so which branch of murderous muslims do u belong so ? sunni ? shia ? salafi ?
then make fun of the terrorism ! not a man who died ages ago and a whole religion !
an ideologically sick person is what you are ... and to look at ya who would think such evil
you deny is own words ? you do not know your own religion
it is actually a quote from emilia zapata
ignorance are the most ignorant ppm on earth.
you are disrespecting my belief but it is ok cause you it has 0 effect me
yes i am but i believe in the religion of muhammad not the transformed islam nowadays.
where did ii give excuse to extremism ??? bbyedude
you need to love itself a bit üòÇ why so burnt man ,go enjoy life a bit
yes. if i am which race ?
smite the infidels where u find them ...... belief that does not cause harm .... not buying sorry.

in solidarity with all the journalists pursuing their profession and freedom of speech .
this cartoon sharing is only compelling law abiding muslims to think of ur intentions skeptically.
instead of making fun of anyone is religion hang baghdad, drag him do anything but spare the religion
in solidarity like how the world is cartoonists have drawn their tribute. here is two :
this kind of attitude is not going to help you in discrediting terrorism.

you know what is sad about indian media ? we do not have a , with guts to offend one
i also hear stories journalists in vernacular media as extortionist, owners of vernacular media very powerful
it is the vernacular media guys who are really gutsy, not the ones shouting from studios in delhi
not about me. know many indian journalists, especially in vernacular media who take risks every day.
media has lots of guts - enough to question nations security forces on & amp ; practice !
they just forgotten media gives us the report from tax mumbai.
media do not even have guts to question waist.
. another sad thing about india is that politicians organize pogroms and sectarian violence
anyone killed anyone who mocked hindus killed ?
solidarity only till death is around corner.!
i know some journalists in small cities/towns who work in the face of serious threats
. calls " stupid " & amp ; calls for editorial " common sense . " capitulation of free speech
editorial foolishness is now punishable by death ? now let me think ...
would you not prefer racists expose themselves ?
silly and bad taste reason they are great and efficient
agreed. i‚Äôm glad you have the freedom to say that
there goes any desire to subscribe to the financial times. shameful !
ft just remember you can have a newspaper because of free speech even if its to insult dead journalists
should you be allowed to say this if in offended ?
so being stupid is now a capital offense.
oh my ... ft falling deeper and deeper ...
in other words should not have worn that dress ‚Äú. sickening.
i trust you‚Äôll be pushing the newspaper that employs you to re-publish the cartoons then ?
bylined not staff editorial. authored by
so bottom being offended justifies uncivilized retaliation.
the title of the article and click on the link it will open
free speech should not be a shield for racism.
good question where is this coming from exactly in ft ?
do you think silly and in bad taste is why uk newspapers are not showing the cartoons ?
shameful capitulation of on free speech and outrageous insult to the victims
free speech is uncomfortable. its supposed to be.
of course white people enjoy offending others camp ; call it free speech
the editors were racist but do not deserve death
again its good that you can say that.
no i think they are silly and in bad taste. but i reject self-censorship imposed by murder
in other the punishment fits the crime ?
exposing white racism is uncomfortable. i know
i do not condone murder but racism is a bitch
i am so sick of ppl tiptoeing around the fact that this was an islamic attack . the politically correct
of course not all religious fundamentalism is disgusting
that would be the point to address.
you mean condones murder of nonbelievers apologists seem to forget that
it also says that for apostasy you kill people who wish to leave the islamic faith
and more importantly a based attack. died to faith first and extremism second.
it is not what the koran says, but what muslims think it says
is pretty much following the ~ 1500 yr old playbooks to a t)
funnies and liberals of all religions are still using the same book.
its not about all all the muslims may not be terrorists but their scripture certainly is.
you may enjoy this : refusal to reprint cartoons is to capitulate to terrorism
not at all. we do not follow a book condoning murder.
if you disagree with your religion is fundamentalists, there is something wrong with your religions fundamentals '

do you even believe yourself ?
should that state be named ?
the same who pour mosques with hundreds millions $. qatar and usa terrorists states.
the is not meant to be taken completely literally nor was every verse intended for every era
it does represents as in koran and sunny. face it.
but it is not misinterpreted - it is very clear and all prominent muslim scholars agree on it.
. gladly low. duran 60:8 duran 15:2 -3most importantly duran 2:256
do not tempt me ! what about koran 9:5, 28, 29 ?
look who is jumping to conclusions ...
you are completely ignoring the peace verses and all the good that it has in it and misinterpreting a
correct step would be to spread true islamic knowledge before verses like this are misinterpreted
a better understanding of the european freedom of expression and the place of prophet(pbuh) in muslim faith
men go set your head on fire until your face resembles a melted wellington boot !

as an atheist i do not see these as representing islam any more than the kkk represent christianity.
. one of the first to condemn suicide bombing.
i am dense. which school and which arab state ?
do not blurt out nonsense if you have no knowledge behind it.
what do you do with the verse of the sword (koran 9:5)- that disaster of allah ?
which state ?
joking man. i live in lebanon
that was one of my guesses. thanks.
couple of verses that no major shook agree with you on.

stop hijacking our faith you crazed murderers ! thoughts and prayers with victims & amp ; their families .
why yes they did. and throughout history christians have brutalized every people they encounter.
this is one of my favorites. shows a bit of internal upheaval in islam.
this is a very good question where does it come from, what makes the violence ok ?
thanks for speaking out maria. your voice is more powerful than mine.
since there is been over 25,000 deadly islamic terrorist attacks. how many from the ira ?
you call them crazed in fact they are islamic terrorists. only 1 kills over cartoons.
this is true we only refer to the radicals
but is not that what the koran tells them to do ?
this was never about who enslaved whom, it was about you bigots tarring with the same brush
nope. it is all left wing biased politically correct bullshit.
time to reform that religion.
why does your faith generate so much violence ?
' of course being anyone who has a differing opinion right ?
hope you are doing well ... any support i can give other than war with trolls ...
if you are going to compare all islamic attacks to one politically backed terrorist outfit ...
so they fucking well should ! they created the problem to begin with !
i do not know you but i love what you have said. thank you.
this is what islamic fascists are saying atm. what is the ira saying ?
how are you feeling was ?
oh yeah .... do they teach kids anything other than left wing crap nowadays ?
depressing that ppl do not realise most victims of islamic extremists are muslims ‚Ä¶ but i am relieved does
is incompatible with the west !
so that begs the question of why does not the muslim community do more to stop it ?
i am sure most people recognize the attack does not represent the vast majority of muslims
does not need a model. it is its own model : republican fraternity.
i feel sorry for muslims. those gunmen have only gone and made life tougher for them !
typical weak left wing apologist who can not decide if he believes in sexual equality or religious freedom

do not cry your time is coming our children have killed by your airplane in good news
these politicians put on fake tears when they themselves encourage covert state-funded terrorism.
why is it fucking apparent ? sane people do not do thinks like this.
but you are not appalled with anti muslim rallies in germany
you politicians are the problem.

dry ... in sun nah and you are obviously a coconut
and then sadly there are some other verses too.
i would have thought after nell you would know that muslims are not protestants when it comes to scripture
i have told you several times, they are animals. that is all !
just send them to coventry ...

you are not the only victims. all religions are ridiculed
you are only happy when you are victims
shame on danish newspaper for spreading hate ...

murders carried out amp ; blamed on another group is regular occurrence. happened in ireland
anyone can say that. how did they get away after being trapped by cops ?
they had to direct people to fact they were muslims by shouting allah akbar
this is not in the name of islam . these ppl do not represent any religion . no matter what
no it is not. : sorry charlene, but that is crap ‚Äù
caution attack on could well be an orchestrated manipulation designed to stigmatize a community
please actually read the charlene. specifically 33:57 through 33:61.
sorry but that is crap
of no sensible person would say otherwise.
bullshit ... only deeply religious nuts would slaughter real people over an imaginary god is hurt feelings
pussycat not even a little ! but the people would still have pulses
agree cw majority of are disgusted by this attack !
where does it say that ! seems you are spreading rumors.
so were it not for religion these men would be perfectly balanced individuals, you reckon ?
stop being politically correct. this is islam and the killers did what duran says them to do.
you have interpreted the the same way terrorists do !
there is no justification in islam, or in the duran for this sort of act.
over a cartoon i doubt it

teen girl in your area :
ah alright. noted. thanks.
fact : most every journalist in india will stand with . but not one publication will reprint their most controversial
do not have to risk their lives - or freedom- individually. everyone publishes the cartoons together.
do not expect our journos to have that kind of integrity
answer a question with a question -- our journos know best
how about eminent journalists like you have the index cartoon as the dp for a symbolic solidarity ?
not an it is a question
she does not want to die
how convenient an huh ?
thank u praise your courage to show the cartoons
satire is controversial ... beat hie wash
would their cartoons be printed in western media tomorrow you think
seen this minister asking every single newspaper to publish !
actually most media has re tweeted previous covers of the magazine, including me
u can answer it lead the way by airing the work !
cartoon as in mode is controversial leader ?
most every journalist in will stand with. but not one publication will reprint their most controversial work.
answer is with you only. dare to reprint/show in india. .
enough of appeasement. now time to oppose and reject the cult of extremism.
in reporting the story , the telegraph has pixilated charlie hebdo is la vie de mahomet :
spineless cowards post the fucking cartoon u pussies
why oh why ?
cowards ... giving in to this murderous bunch ...
quite right. hence put pressure on them to do their job.
the telegraph shows little respect for what these french free-speakers died for
others trying to compromise freedom of speech in the face of this continued assault on western values
no. we are winning.
... because giving in to such pathetic demands has stopped islamic extremism ?

hard to think that when i see the reactions to these things.

anti no. anti extremist. yes !
kills children every day in iraq and syria. france will strike many times
went back for him because he was the wrong muslim. france will not be cowed you devil-worshipper
he is got a sharp point !!!
third thought : defending the rights that charlie hebdo defended means defending free speech , not attacking muslims .
disagree with that remark about muslims. we have schools here that preach death to the infidel
by the mm has repudiated the free expression that the likes of fought for.
perhaps they could return the favor ?
and a cartoon for today by ( via & amp ; )
why is it dated for tomorrow

so how can you prove mohammad stole from jesus and put in the duran ?
nice idea but does not exactly look well attended does it ?
just because we are not there physically does not mean we are not there spiritually/wholeheartedly

say goodbye to your twitter account. that is a death threat.
fundamentalists get a few victories against unarmed women and children and think everyone else will surrender.
brilliant piece by on how the paris shootings must not lead to more islamophobia :
no mention of militant in the piece. he is avoiding the issue by concentrating on islamophbia
i think one of the cops shot yesterday was a muslim man ?
no to but yes to images that muslims find offensive. it is tricky ...
why would shouting revenge lead to islamophobia(new word) again and again error
the problem is how to stop these outrages. all else is just noise.
meanwhile in book harm kill 2000 in one day ...
you cannot compare to norway. very different.
does anyone know if are over represented in male prisoner population in norway ?

this is what courage look like.

the correct well done them.
yeah that is the definition of hardcore.
these cartoons are all poignant tributes to victims of the charlie hebdo attack
... ! do not kill the don bass !!!!!!
satire is a symptom of a healthy society and always a prime target for fundamentalism . there is no '
yes in you can slag off christianity mock it deplores it but islam is supported by our laws
i honestly do not know how you deal with an extremist evil like this though.
i know. but the law has no business trying to stop people feeling offended.
not until have finished with that threat to our way of life, katie hopkins.
wish every human treated each other as they wish to be treated, real simple life, but ....
but ... extremist on both sides of anything ... usually taught that way as kids.
i mean morally the law is all over the place on this
indeed. the remnants of laws on blasphemy and lese-majeste alike need to be swept away.
i agree. but these butchers will keep coming with these random attacks.
yes they will ... that is the world we are always in : personal choices-actions-consequences ... and me ?
even after the ' insulting ' bit had been removed from the public order act ?
they are barbarians and totally at odds with vast majority of muslim world. they are evil.
random in the sense of being seemingly out of the blue. this would appear to be targeted.
total agree ... and what is ; does to women/children in their own community ? beyond disgusting
not sure i consider the uk is justice system ' healthy ', tba
and every atrocity by any extremist should be condemned equally.
extreme fundamentalist is as deadly as ‚Äú christian extreme fundamentalist ‚Äú blowing up abortion clinics
deliberately stirring up religious hatred is unlikely to end well.
latest : at least 11 dead in shooting at french magazine ; france raises terror alert to highest level
the municipal police do not the 3 others branches do.
let me see now. kill them ?
cops do not carry guns wt
refer to my last post ‚Ä¶ not all french police carry guns.
not exactly the national police carry guns, but the local municipalities generally do not.
get a gun. should not scare anyone.
i always do i highly recommend it
oh have a great day and do not forget to pack
so sad. praying for the victims and their families.
you shoot them in the face. very simple
coming to soon thanks to obama.
because they have worthless liberal cowards running their country too
why do not police carry guns ? makes no sense.
i always do ! i highly recommend it ‚Äù low, i will remember that .....
my guess is that will change very soon. ‚Äù üëç
the two guys that were cops that were killed did not carry guns
my guess is that will change very soon.
they carry guns. they do.
coming to soon thanks to obama. ‚Äù god forbid. this scares me.
the need for house of worship security and emergency preparedness has never been greater !
they carry guns. they do. ‚Äù thank you
the magazine covers the islamic terrorists did not want you to see
they do not represent and own islam stop helping them !!!!
but that is what they are !
godless heathens they thought they could kill the magazine, just gave it mega airtime
yes. is completely against violence to humans, animals, environment and all creatures.
i hate hate french racism 2 arabs & amp ; africans & amp ; balks more,...
led an army and killed those who opposed islam. not a value judgment, just history
so religions say a lot of things. obviously, they thought those people were not innocent
sabra i agree with that 100%
i condemn the cowardly attacks. terrorism is not religion. this inhumane. god bless everyone
of course all should not be blamed.
thanks so much for sharing. just added it here :
nothing in history would bear out your conclusion
who the fuck are these philistines they decide who lives and dies ? stop defending these cowards.
when you call them islamic ‚Äú terrorists you allow them to own an entire faith stop !!!
what would you call them then ?
god bless all the families who tonight are in pain over their loss
forbids evil and knows their intentions. all muslims should not be blamed for what those did
this has nothing to do with christians it is about a bunch of godless heathens
good. faith is worthless. step into modernity and use your reason.
if they thought they killed the magazine they just gave it a world audience # idiots
not interested in debating history just talking about the rats in paris today.
how do you shout god is good then fire your gun on a defenseless person fucking cowards
you can be born by birthright does not make you a christian. same thing. philistines dogs

look i respect your i would like to end that discussion. sorry if i hurt you.

similar how solar system = newtonian physics, atom = quantum physics. very different

there are many ways to honor . one is to abolish all blasphemy laws in europe
. by closing down faith schools.
blasphemy laws are something from dark ages they should be wiped out

theres blasphemy laws in ? what the hell ?
laws still exist in many ms(recent application in greece) . condemns abroad but not at home
how could anyone in their right mind have such a law in europe ?
like that would stop any fanatical murderer
could you please be more precise ?
if you tweeted but will not tweet today , i think we can all figure out the reason .

french police asking media to not broadcast live images at scene of paris hostage situation so police locations are not
pay attention amp !
this is a special message to is it not ?
these animals have hostages godspeed ...
" 100 lashes if you do not die of laughter . " eleven people killed over this .
seems to disrespect and not islam.
saying that we know the motive when the unidentified killers are still at large is unnecessary and stupid
they died because of radical islam, not because of a cartoon.
well here is the oeuvre to rt
in fact the precipitating satire was directed at isis.
best response to attack -- other than catching and punishing killers -- is to escalate blasphemous satire .
after bombing the women and children in an attempt to head off isis
so why does ppm in your area give a fuck about a cartoon in france ?
i just do not see satire as ' kicking ' anyone
good choice of most chinese are poor
its all just as much b.s as that part anyway. whatever
i agree entirely. their reverence must not be ours. they cannot kill everyone.
yes they can not stop us all !
are you laughing at the asinine tweet ?
if your neighbor was raped you do not care because he is not fucking with you ?
leave alone that sounds like a great plan
so ppm are mad at a cartoon about the isis leader ???
leave them the fuck damn, what is wrong w white guys ?
you can not win an argument with a stupid person.
is not it just easier to treat people how u want to be treated ?
i am laughing cos its true
it is true that it is an asinine tweet ?
at least 12 killed in shooting at office of french satirical : charlie held
dear , if you can not handle being lampooned then you are not ready to be politically relevant .
that tweet is satirical !
it just went crediting you, on my
except that was created by cia/mos sad, and is not muslim ; all is zionism ;
could not have said it betters ! that tweet is now on my
prayers for supports freedom of the press !
they seem to think that if people voted against cartoons, that would have been ok.
. you are looking at the black beating heart of the political, you fuck wits.
thanks so much for sharing. your tweets is now featured on media we aggregate
take for example. politics is a homogeneous people making friend-enemy distinctions with a view to war
that tweet deserves to be featured ! check it out :
the sparrow lies on the contrary, bemoaning that isis will not join depoliticized liberal democracy
i doubt that they are the sort of people to be concerned about such an admonition.
creating environment for heinous idiots to evolve if we had president w/ at the time

stop today is flogging of . you can not ' condemn ' charlie hebdo attack yet flog/imprison freethinkers !
killing by the state on behalf of all citizens is the worst kind of crime and murder :
free thinking is the antithesis of islamic dictatorships, where bullshit can kill people
i would rather not discuss this with someone who believes in the devil. sorry
yes. there is unlikely to be universal agreement for any particular execution. poor countries.
here we have another specimen ‚Äú called who wants abolish army, police n security forces
bullying people using words is what it means to be a free-thinker ?
i am proud of down with islam
can animals which attack to kill have place in civil society ?
unless you condemn sharia that prescribes death penalty for blasphemy, al this is meaningless
goes to show 2 things : 1) confusion within that philosophy 2) double standards
they are hypocrites amp ; racists free-thinkers who were hiding under their so-called cartoons
agreed the freethinkers ' idea of mocking/bullying via cartoons is unacceptable.
. they are condemning it for no other reason than to save face.
. might kill to save money, though.
the softness of a religion & amp ; its universal acceptance of all humans, needs recounts !
fox news does the same to anyone with brains until they submit, they love it.
why there is no straight answer to he last question ? stop living like ostrich
they have a divine license to do torture people alas it will persist

how the jewish pro-censorship lobby legitimized attacks on charlie hebdo for " offensive " speech
great. how much exactly have you donated to stop the kkk ?
they do not.
condemnation. that solves the problem of countless young western muslim men traveling to syria.
then it is not your place to call out others. peace.
and i pointed out that you are a lazy overbearing fuck, accurately. open your mind :
i think you misunderstand how courts work.
gala. what is going on in turkey ? feels like it is going backwards, no ?
and the problem is there are too many of those going around these days.
i already know the answers. i was pointing out the lack of information in your pointless if.
offs ... mt how jewish pro-censorship lobby legitimized attacks on charlie held for ‚Äú offensive ‚Äú speech
this is simply an excuse to get passage in prison by any means available.
its all about freedom of speech ! just ask julian passage ....
pay attention it solves the myth of ' countless young western muslim men traveling to syria. '
ha. what facts are those ?
no it is not right to assume and fabricate some ‚Äú maybe story ‚Äú just to avoid questioning.
considering the were killing my kind. nothing
our laws in were good enough regarding placing of servers but now. regarding alleged rape.?
a complete if guide to muslims denouncing terrorism.
they are the same american.
i do not blame i blame the extremist clerics that radicalize young kids who need help.
i am surprised it took them this long to find the real culprits :
. to quote tom ‚Äú and everybody hates the jews. ‚Äú
for and tell me how many results you find.
does the right to ' feel ' safe outstrip someone is right to be safe ?
... is that the structure of laws does not match with requirements to their structure !
i strongly condemn this barbaric attack as a turkish muslim
your gives only represent numbers. what about haas ? hezbollah ? al ada ? boko harm ?
you are and you are stupid, and clearly want to ignore the facts.
replace ' ' with = ‚Äú insert name here ‚Äú. generic.
not my job. you wish to inform. then inform correctly.
unfortunately we have a brogan trouble.
i am sure they are gonna be super fair to passage once he reaches the us.
if you blame any * muslim for you are saying there is blood on your hands for brain
have you apologized yet for the massacre ?

one victim killed in the attack on charlie hebdo was a muslim policeman , ahmed merabet .
in fact they were two muslim killed, the other was mustard, a worker of charlie.
the revolution devours its own children
they probably did not realism that he was a muslim !
nobody disrespects him than the one who claims he kills b/c of him.
which proves that terrorism t associated with religion ...
beheading now what you want to convey good and bad muslim ultimately islamic teaching are intolerance
megabit above a policeman.
perhaps that the terrorists do not actually have a religious agenda and anti-muslim prejudices
that is terrorism is not associate with religion.
the attack was not against muslims or non muslims. it was against those who disrespected prophet mohammad.
they r not jihads. they r disgrace to our religion
wrong. teachings our full of peace but preachers in our era have exploited it.
may all the deceased journalists and police officers rest in peace
they are killing humanity and every think (since 1948)
headline from this week : isis executes phorphet mohamed ; police chase terrorists
yeah ... it is obvious ...
it is that newspaper that promotes anti-palestinian racism.
the irony goes to 11. is every bit as extremist as.
they are citing the events to promote their islamophobia.
... my mistake. i did not notice the account ...
. is this front page from this week ? it says october in the top right hand corner ...
short piece from me on why no one is to blame for murder but the murderers themselves

sad that there are people who need convincing of your point.
excellent short piece on why no1 is to blame for murder but the murderers themselves ‚Äù

have you read the whole article ? that is what he is saying.
smart piece. thanks for that.
you have been rendered speechless. along with rest of media too scared to print cartoons
why did the telegraph censor his comic ? they literally that all over what stood for.

would that everyone all faiths) were as moderate as you
stories of not directives to do such.
difference between shitty old testament stories and direct orders of duran.
thankfully the majority of jews, buddhists, zoroastrians, animists, etc do the same.
does not make the point invalid.
i know who i would rather be taken hostage by.
fair what ever brings you joy. (without harming others)
adhere to the teachings of christ above all others, including old testament
while the west fought foreign wars , we ignored the threat from within our own societies says
another person who does not know skip policy and then assumes we have none !
absolutely how did we let skip become such a threat !!?
and what happened to this ?
check this out
and positive discrimination has caused a rot we will never get rid of
what tax policy keeping the 11500 pages we have and adding some, great
threat to society you are either a wind up merchant or a fucking idiot
and you my have simply confirmed those fears with your erudite and intelligent contribution
of course skip are anti eu but that does not mean there is no other policy low
nothing constructive to say ... then do not attempt humor. this is serious issue
come on if you understand rule of system tell us how the present gives you encouragement !
you forgot laconic fuck you cunt !!!
is that official the policies are all being re-written as we speak
does not want to know scared of it i suppose close your eyes and it will go away mate
charlie hebdo : we ignored the threat from within our own societies , says
no you tell i have not targeted those people.
we murder every day. is that justified to you ?
peddling fear and hatred is in nobody is interest - except outrage is
if you are in now would you feel threatened ?
being gay is not a choice, but skiers still mock that. same as they mock non-whites
agenda rt green party is the new communist party
a skip supporter calling me ignorant ? now that is hilarious !
can talk the he is never had to make a decision about anything.
so you believe in telling lies lest the truth frightens people ? by the way, expressing reservations ...
you are forensic in your analysis. you have changed my mind. that garage is a git !
why are you targeting people with mental illnesses ? that is disgusting you should be ashamed.
i am working boy. so do not get your point
well i am so i use the british version. you can not be british when it suits
both spellings are recognized. my ipad is set to us english & amp ; corrects me. üëç
using the word retarded ‚Äú is cruel and disgusting.
totally this is the unintended consequences of a politically correct over liberalizing of society !
whether it is gay ppm etc
i was not justifying i was explaining why it might happen
you seem perfectly happy justifying it a few tweets back.
i do killing innocent muslims every day is hardly going to help, is it ?
is murdering people justified to you ?
but any civilian death is wrong and i condemn it !
engage with the debate. be specific. what is untrue ? mass immigration ? multiculturalism ?
as for educating a recent you gov poll showed skiers the least educated
what does ever do ?
do not get all no teacher ' with me, pal.
it is ' loony ' love, learn to speak english
is a voice from the wilderness like enoch but this time we must listen & amp ; act
so you would rather be under nazi rule and no intervention ?
my point is killing any civilians is wrong
it can be spent both ways ' dingbat. see ‚Äú mooney tunes ‚Äú.
hence why the nurse has been called, armed with a straight jacket.
what exactly was ill informed ?
you are hilarious. nurse ! section this man
are they not both voter concerns ? should not politicians be addressing them as such ?
maybe not but your party and leader does and you support them, so.
intentionally stirs up hate & amp ; fear, so that is a laugh
the continued and incessant bleating about immigration and multiculturalism
funny cause i have never felt threatened by muslims, skip twats though.
no point talking politics with a green, u all suggest we just hug
and and are only a threat cause we make them a threat
that is an intentional misspelling for a cartoon. not very bright !
what you talking about intervention in what ?
do not go mistaking what comes out of outrage is mouth with note truth '.
the charming ppm i have been chatting to do
and that justifies murder go crawl back under your rock
i had deleted it as not enough character 2b clear that islam, not skip is the problem.
he is one idiot of thousands of muslims and condemned continually by muslim leaders
i oppose any civilian deaths unlike others who just hate muslims
i do not think anybody here just hates muslims.
... about mass immigration and multiculturalism is not hatred
how is he ill informed ?
green party is the new communist party
intervention from the and allies.
but ' ' can be british when it suits ? choudrey for example ?
or are you saying one racist upper make all skiers racist ?
i thought skip believed in free speech ? and no more disgusting than things you lot say
just shows how ignorant you are then read and educate yourself.
true but i find minorities a tad boring, same with thatcher ite tory twat economics
i hate the green party even more than left wing labor
we were fine until we started interfering in muslim countries
well i would rather be a ' loony ' left winger than a retarded right winger
good one dimwit how about isis & amp ; al ada ? think before you speak ...
maybe if we were not killing innocent muslims every day, that may help
he is the opposite of britain first, but just as much a twat
i am sure they appreciate your support
not at all why would i ? fear leads to hate leads to war
are a bigger threat to society than any muslim imo
so why make the argument of equivalence ?
fear leads to hate that leads to war ? give me examples.
supports turkey is eu membership, what more do you want ?
the bad actions of some muslims does not mean all muslims are bad
we kill they kill us. we do not really get anywhere
we make them a threat. live in the real world !
bye kipper.
you are suggesting he is informed ? his brand of pub-bore quacking demonstrates the opposite.
is the biggest disease - social liberalism. using by immigrants.
it is said a lot i think. just that leaders ignore the people.
i do not understand your prattle or the point of it
it is cos now i know green party supporters demonize the mentally ill. nice one ! üëè
i skip are the only option if you want to regain control of our borders
i garage is a threat we should not ignore
is right. another case of political correctness failing society
i do not want the turks showed their true colors in cobain
mentally ill people were not even mentioned. retarded is no worse than ' mooney ' imo
this is what skip agrees with too, liebour led us to illegal wars.
unfortunately though we kill every day and nothing is said
it is really important to spread news of all the muslims who are condemning the mass murder at
and what about those who are not ?
that is right you fucking sand nigger. fuck you ! muslims must pay
look better plus twitter isn t a source that could explain anything !
no it is absolutely because muslims should not feel obliged to say anything about it.
what human would justify it ?
it is really important to see which countries condemn the attack on
to emphasis that not all people of a similar religion do awful things ?
i threw a pork chop at muslim today ! lmao
coming from a sand nigger who is religion murders innocent people daily
its really important that moderates start fighting extremists who viciously tarnish and slander islam.
what is important is helping the victims and finding those responsible.
as long as you equally spread news of all those who do not
... and anybody who is not.
stop killing people and stay out of my country. we are sick of you nut jobs
why is it really important ? why is it more important than condemning the perks of this insanity ?

print the cartoons show everyone you practice the freedoms you claim to hold so dear.

stop letting these savages into our countries period

just shameful rt lifenews : the terrorist attack in paris organized by the us intelligence
that is very predictable a speech. expecting more nasty stuff to happen as the oil prices drop.

please comment this meeting isis leader
privately own cartoon magazine is freedom of speech, government run chanel is propaganda
a great many frauds , the guardian included , claiming to be " charlie hebdo " but too cowardly to
they are not racist. they mock religion and extremism. and they are required to know context.
please see this covers. you can disagree on cartoons, but they were not racist.
well that makes it alright.
oh yes the great western values, up held by the cia in abe grain
i have been trolled. nice job.
a jihad beheading the prophet mohammad sends a message about extremists bastardizing the religion.
entire mainstream media in us found ways to avoid showing the cartoons. pathetic.
people should be free to say it (and i to disagree harshly) .
fried is quite the opposite of what i am defending here : peaceful free expression for all.
why do you want to gratuitously offend ordinary muslims ?
that is why i talked about ethnicity, not race.
other frauds fake. only official donation page : check facts on
freedom of anything is not a physical entity/law, it is a privilege. hence not absolute.
this makes no sense. how can you understand a visual work without seeing it ?
freedom of opinion is absolute or is not.
not reprinting it accomplishes the fundamentalism victory. christian or islamic or whatever.
this is the same retarded reasoning of those who equate islam with terrorism, only mirrored.
that is why we listed them. we read it.
the are more difference between individuals than between ' races '
it is what people believe it is what they do that is important
understanding why these people were murdered is not important, in your opinion ?
let is blame the victim !
like antisemitism for which philippe val(publisher) fired his employee ?
defending freedom of religion is not the same as endorsing religion or holding it as sacred.
oh i thought it was censored * now *.
not on my time line will go and check the uk papers now ...
saying is a terrorist religion is not defending freedom of speech
nothing is you need to keep that in mind.
its not hard to utterly condemn the murder of journalists and oppose the circulation of racist cartoons
yea and that makes it worse - the left should be defending religious freedom
no it does not. and no you are not ‚Äú free ‚Äú at least in physiological sense.
these cartoons are part of a campaign of portraying muslims as being ' apart ' from society
publishing them. seen a couple on twitter. do not like them.
the guardian published an editorial explaining exactly why they would not be publishing them.
i am glad you can tell the difference com most muslims/jews can not
they mocked and in the same rude manner, often in same cartoon or issue.
you can talk about their art without reprinting their art. it is entirely superfluous.
so anti feminism is not racism ?
" we are all charlie ‚Äù : european newspapers show solidarity with charlie hebdo after attack
but will the times do this ?
every newspaper in the world including wsw should publish those cartoons.
we are all charlie ‚Äù european newspapers show solidarity wt charlie held after attack ‚Äú
he sews charlie ‚Äù : european newspapers show solidarity with after attack ‚Äù
i bet ... not really .... a few days too late !
bottom line how to stop such killings ? any thoughts ?
real solidarity would be reprinting held cartoons in every newspaper in france and all over the world !
are they printing of mo ?
how come you said nothing when israel murdered 14 journalists last year during their attack on ?
no we are not all charlie !!
except many of you wont reprint the cartoons faithfully.
how people in france view muslims : very positively
22/5/13 boston 15/4/13 london 7/7/05 usa 9/11/01 ..... that is reality
even though they had killed hundreds of the muslims and tortured and stole from many more.
not religious ' but religious ‚Äú there is a big difference.
we agree there but that is an issue with muslims not islam.
masses of crime. halifax, birmingham, manchester ...
is if he wages war on islam afterwards.
to know how incredibly misunderstood it is, by muslims and non-muslims alike.
how people in france view muslims : very positively ‚Äù
cartoons drawn for held :
history has all been violent. do not pinpoint islam or buddhism as the exception on either end ...

if there was another attack in the 80 in madrid
rightly so. can not be held responsible for the oddballs. nor norwegians be for
wile the violent men claim they do what mohammad did, and follow the korans orders to muslims.
and so far has not been taken into account what i mean that.
most terrorist attacks in this world are committed by muslims ... fact
what book did you read about the prophet is life from ? because it was obviously very bias
how people in france view muslims : very positively ‚Äù
no then it will be fanatics vs religious so dr fanatics n not religious

violent men manipulate my religion so in response i should fix ppm is understanding of islam.

how people in france view muslims : very positively ‚Äù jesus italy !
women in other religions or countries earned those same rights yes people manipulate & amp ; misinterpret islam now
the in also commit violence in the name of the buddha
do you see what happens in burma where buddhists and buddhists priests violently murder muslims ?
is a beautiful r not islamviolent ppm abuse it just as violent ppm abuse many things.
n like how is fault is it.
the media just loves to spotlight muslim violence. you barely here anything about burma
by says crime says dat al the muslims committed it !
those in favor obviously live in the upper class suburbs and not in touch with inner city reality
charlie hebdo shooting & amp ; the religion of peace : via

why r people so dumb. and still say there peaceful.
you read too much from twitter-tards, all that is obvious to the most casual observer.

you mean the religion of peaces, head arms legs all chopped for being gay or apostate
do not be afraid to post pictures of mohamed.

it seems that u r retard n need a bttr treatment
m not supporting any kind of terrorism ... at the cartoonists deserve even worse than this.
blasphemy is a and is not an excuse for violence. ever.
there is no reasoning with you guys. different mindset, you belong in 150 a.d. odd cunt !
the voted for terrorist palestine so now they got it on their streets
i said it is a non-crime. meaning it should not be a crime. anywhere.
that is in fact supporting the shooting ‚Äú they had it coming ‚Äú
he is blocked me.
sews used 4 solidarity with victims
. . i would strongly advise you to shut up your stupid big mouth.
i am out of this luck. theirs no reasoning over their precious religion.
that is the law in ireland
used across the world to show solidarity with ‚Äù
it is a cartoon. do people deserve to die over a drawing ?
people should die over that cartoon ?
your says takes the pacifist approach you hypocritical twat
freedom of press who that mean u play with other ones faith.
that is the problem. it is all too protected. conversation over.
let¬¥s get serious about and west is double standards on freedom of speech !
. you holocaust is not a religion or fictional character. ah well, never mind.
the right to free speech is not an obligation to think/speak about everything
when their free speech is so selective ...
killing millions of people for their race camp ; religion is no equal to mocking a prophet.
should be allowed. as long as it does not call for violence.
unfortunately many have only heard of the ones on tv
as long as you do not ask for another holocaust/violence.
i do not think that is a like-to-like comparison but agree with the sentiment of hypocrisy.
do u think they would ever use a holocaust joke to make a point ‚Äú draw attention ‚Äú ??
there is a story when u point at others u have 4 fingers pointing back at u check hand
that mag mocked the girls captured by book harm. making them look like savages to make a joke
... to mocking a an idea.
in countries with free we do not kill you for either one.
criticizing religion is no hate speech. preventive tweet
i love as much as any other prophet in islam
have you ever considered giving your life to jesus ...?
that magazine mocked those innocent girls taken by biko harm to make a joke about welfare.
only if you are black & amp ; wearing a foodie. or just black.
freedom of the real one, has no red lines, sorry
fox news say a lot of stupid things ...
but there are restrictions on freedom of speech, ex. hate speech
died for if you put your faith in him, he will forgive your sins ...
i one issue deserve freedom of speech the other do not ... double standard yeah !
thus justifying any attack on muslims moderate or not
by the consciences of people.
holocaust cartoons are protected expression in the us. hth.
how do you think are ' oppressed ' in the west ...?
says a cartoonist. and i respect that but i will stick to echo verdicts. ty.
it is a bit of a silly rule ...
do u have a link to the mentioned cartoon ?
that is a huge difference of subject. cartoons of one fake person or cartoons of a massacre
i can write sagas i do not have the time no country is perfect !
double some issues are protected by freedom of speech, others are not
would same mag ever use holocaust to make a joke ... no üòíüòí
no it is not. there is no prohibition of depictions of jesus in christianity.
is targeting everyday by saying they are no different from the terrorists who kill.
not funny and distasteful but still. free speech above all
we are different , pls understand

how quickly people forget the religious crusades, christianity was pretty violent and barbaric as well ...
it is entirely reasonable to hate a religion that reserves the right to go around killing non-believers.
this is very funny. hope you do not mind if i tag it out a little.
no they r saying ppm in glass houses should not throw rocks

nothing could ever make them look ' good!'
no i personally would rather blame the individuals than a whole religion

17 journalists massacres by israel in gaza , 2014 . where were these " freedom of speech " people then
by the way in am an atheist just find all these wars vulgar
consider the number of children) dead in gaza caused by a gov ours supports, much bigger
death in proudly funded by us tax payers (but they are not told about it)
seems to me a better example would be the reporters israel forcibly removed from the zone.
why bigger tragedy i do not agree. both are just as bad.
agree with that to an extent except in gaza the fear of death for yourself or family is greater
that push on duchy pisses me off. fucking awful team.
no religion can justify murder.
that is make it all about you.
was not a war zone ....
i would just say the families of each murdered victim in each country are feeling exactly the same.
i wonder if you would you be saying the same if it was other way ?.
i think we might be arguing over something we agree on.
that is a different argument all together. something i totally agree with.
good win on that we can totally agree even against those thugs and a really crap ref ...... cong
where are the mm news reports ? the solidarity and outrage, so sad r.i.p
i see out point but i think most people would agree gaza is the bigger tragedy
only a selective biased media does flux outrage like no other.

interesting interesting how you will not tweet them yourself.
like publishing the negative and calling it a great photo.
but it is got more white than black in it ? surely racist ?
courage would be to republish cartoons, unaware of its own cowardice
cartoon is not in response to this attack. cartoon is from 2012.
a little too white for me
and it is a large white square ... clearly racist
check the tweet i posted right after the cartoon.
you mean that was not someone is sarcastic on twitter ? omg.
hence the empty box.
cowardice masquerading as bravery. rt the new worker cartoon following the incident.
this is from several years ago
any religion or individual that cowards to these maniacs is asking -
thank god we have free speech, right ?
i think it is a picture of their balls.
this cartoon is from a few years ago.
they published it ironically ‚Äú so they can claim bravery while avoiding a fatwa
if anyone at the new worker had real balls, they would publish charlie held cartoons.
noted. thank you for the clarification.
so what if it is from a few years ago-it fits perfect with yesterdays horrible tragedy in paris.

stereotyping like you are the god of this universe while you are just a scum bag
its imams who radicalize lost kids, not catholic priests, unbeliever.
yes it it is not freedom of speech if it is limited by religious sensitivity
just because some idiots do stuff does not mean we all do stupid stuff.
we have the right to mock anything and everyone, tolerate and live with this
keep calm and fuck your god
you are a human and also museum, you should curse this massacre without saying any excuse.
confidently talking about like you have studied it you are entire life. piss off
with murder. this attack was a combination of intimidation and ignorance together
that is your every other religious fanatic is- problem : you can not tolerate ...
have not beheaded anyone in my life. but yeah whatever you say
i said nothing justifies this crime but keep in mind the intimidation
over all your shallow judgments and dirty languages
fine then please accept the fact that what happened yesterday was a result of religious intolerance
look at is previous tweet and please stop demeaning the conversation !

‚Äò muslims don‚Äôt believe in freedom of speech ‚Äô : anjem choudary on the charlie hebdo attack :
you clearly do not understand what free speech means.
expose their dogma for the delusion it is. people need to know the truth.
well ... it would be better to educate them, than to stir them into a frenzy ...
no ... you are just not a priority ...
i am but a lot of people are not.
sooner we extract ourselves from the european court of human rights the better. kick stirrers like him out
if someone does not like a critique or if the delivery is too blunt it is labeled ridicule.
curiously he exploits the freedom afforded to him to state this.
gay reeducation general bigotry by a wide minority
i am glad he has this right. it exposes him as the utter baboon-flavoured bobwhite he is.
as i they should be shut down ...
if you are not trying silence theists, what is the purpose of your constant ridicule ?...
because you seem to disagree : what other reason, for your persistence, is there ?...
all that ridicule is encouraged more hatred ...
neither many atheists ...
then why are you even disagreeing with me here.
are you getting these like 20 minutes late ?
because it happens on both sides. to err is human, atheism specifically is not the culprit
so the evangelical church should subsequently be shut down as well, as the people behind it.
from ... dogma a point of view or tenet put forth as authoritative without adequate grounds
everyday welfare scrounger sharia pimps like live in uk they breathe in apostate farts-must love smell

if you do not see it, it is only because you do not want to ...
turning a blind eye does not mean atrocities are not happening to others, daily.
can u get him a face lift
... that definition just as well, to atheism, as it does theism ...
i am actually not aware of anyone but conservative news anchors attempting to stir the frenzy '
i agree ... they should be shut down ...

true but most religions have a sense of humor. islam being the exception apparently
do not expect these people to think logically.

indeed. nor should it matter if they decided to make fun of only one religion.
i will bet those equally horrible christians killed 11 people too, right ?
they have the right. that is the point
it should not matter. even if they only attacked islam. should not matter.

the victims of the attack
foreign promoted wars not sure anyone is promoting isis
western media or western powers who control information flow are the ones not giving muslims that voice
being disrespectful is what has dragged civilization through the enlightenment.
people who want to make a point find ways, just look at the radicals
where is all the outcry against these terrorist actions ?
here is what scholars are saying, why is mainstream tv not showing it ??
the victims of the attack ‚Äù names that will be in my prayers üôèüíî
so these guys would be doctors, police ? not rapists beheading people ?
i do not understand what you mean ?
open your eyes you will find them
my point u march for your people, not those you religion effects
they march for and nobody listens although there are serious war crimes there.
as a i utterly condemn what are vicious and cowardly acts of terrorism against innocent civilians.
are against these at the same time there is no respect for muslims and their religion
hang the terrorists then under that peace walk, hahahaha
is the aftermath of iraq etc
you should really stop blaming every issue on the west.
the victims of the attack ‚Äù a true travesty !

the only thing ex communist countries did right ; not importing (and after. not integrating) islam
in leftist western those immigrants were never encouraged to integrate well into society
or perhaps they don‚Äôt win because they‚Äôre not good enough.

what do you mean abwehr = intel services and regina triggers extreme muslim attacks ?
some are saying that the attackers are speaking ru in the execution did. what do you think ?
just can not print flags fast enough this morning considering the counter-protesting 2 days ago ...

i am uneasy with the portrayal of charlie hebdo as magazine that " provokes " . no , it publishes
it is a satirical publication. satire provokes. at least, it damns well should.
is that not the point of satire ?
when you fully well know the backlash then it is provocative
some paintings above ' us. others do not.
they responded to provocation. spoke the truth as they saw it with humor, and conviction.
the point of satire is to provoke. if it does not it is not satire.
still their choice and that is not a standard civilized people should have to adhere to.

congrats on your tweet !
my thoughts are with you in your grief
' attack on media ... world community can not allow extremists to silence free flow of opinions , ideas '
also governments most of the time silence your opinion if it is not inline with their interest
when the satanic verses was published, the un attacked france for not banning it.
west adopted extremist since used bin laden against russia. they stood with them against arab goats

so you are saying it is okay that terrorists killed 12 people because they disagreed with free speech ?
but you are still missing the fact that if we hide the posts, the terrorists win.
the answer is more speech. speak out, speak out against terrorists who hijack your religion.
help me because i fail to understand it.
apologist for what just because i disagree with the cartoons makes me an apologist for terrorists ?
its your choice to take offense. make better choices.
their covers lampooning catholic church hypocrisy, the inability to criticism jewish extremism, etc ...
we finally get there. took your time. all boils down to that in the end.
win what and what do we gain ?
why should there be another objective ? offense can be their objective and still be valid.
are the greatest victims of their own silly religion.
terrorists follow an ideology rather than having a mental illness.
they use religion to control. they are fascists. we need humor
much higher up the list than publishing some stupid, thoughtless cartoons.

huge respect to the for printing them - we need every news company to do the same.

was literally the point myself and others were making to be fair ...
we can not be cowards. they are drawings offs.
and in a quiet corner of twitter, is the problem entirely.
but in the continuing to offend muslims. i agree with this view
people should be free to report the offending cartoons, but is this a reasonable thing to do ?
absolutely. a heinous crime and expression of ideas must be protected. being respectful is a choice.
you mean like all the major muslim nations have ?
you should be more offended by those who use your religion to firebomb and kill.
the whole world is offended by what happened the offensive part was death.
agreed and no sane person would say otherwise but that is the point, the terrorists are not
uh ... guess that says it all rights there.
did they have a special edition satirizing christians and jews ? they intentionally targeted islam to get publicity
i am sure their grieving friends and families are comforted.
what is yours do not piss of religion of peace, they might kill you ?
no problem at all with that.
they were not thoughtless. you do not get it. never will.
given contrast between the terrorist & amp ; muslim policeman, i am avoiding sweeping generalizations.
that question is offensive bro.
defend your right by using guns and killing people. grow up. satire is healthy in society
fuck oppression
do not the cartoonists have the right to speak out about religions then ?
it is your choice to take offense. make better choices.
what if i am offended that women are allowed to speak out of turn ?
may i suggest it is time to report your comments on taking offense ? they seem very apt.

... eds pages full of thugs inciting violence against muslims + mosques. you know it
good god man you are finally coming ' round !!!!
shame then is t it you condemned the likes of eds when they were warning against exactly this
i would like to echo this. i stand with
the eds page is nothing bu anti-muslim hate - muslims called rats, muzzles, cancer etc
her ' because you know she is telling the truth.
i have been opposing for 20 years. i am not just now coming round
they attract some morons. but tommy robinson stresses opposition to islamism, not islam.
what else would you expect from such an object ?
no i hear it from eds supporters mouths and emails. i do not always agree with uhf
just muted she is unable to take a hint
the only reason people block. good of her to admit it.

" this is an extremist element . this is not islam " - no 10
. not as if the prophet forbade depiction of himself, right ?
the question is how many moderates agree in silence with the extremists ?
you can say extremists are a minority but all spring from islam
like the ones who say one thing in public and another inside the mosque
oh yes this wake up.
it is a misinterpretation of religious texts.
read up on the religion before you make statements like that.
based on whose opinion yours ? criticising islam a religion is hate speech is it ?
you are not a if you spread hate. did you know that ?
they worship a god who commanded mohammad to kill the infidels. is that who you worship ?
for instance are not there many acts of violence described in the bible ?
good example our god is a god of love and peace.
you should educate yourselves before you make sweeping generalizations
this is an extremist element. this is not islam ‚Äú - no 10 ‚Äù üëèüôå
you are talking about skip racists there ?
that is a gross misconception ! the extremists are a very small minority !
how come it is the only one were violence emanates ? roots of violence are in islam !
i forgot how no 10 can see into men is hearts to determine how accurate their theism is
like the police officer who was murdered yesterday ?
basically you are saying that islam is synonymous with terrorism which is ignorant and islamophobic

gagged since 25 years by the press for breaking the silence on corruption
us also threatened prohibiting us from allowing israeli jets to refuel in india and bomb sarghoda
us wanted a stable 2 transport oil through. by god they got was they wished 4
the question is or more than 30years get it protected and supported by and nobodyqit
we would not want to affect sales.
you forget the illicit child pakistan
we can never defeat terrorism if we have allies like israel who brutalize a dispossessed people
yes that is well received legend
shame the us was quick to come to pakistan is rescue in 1972 although india was saving bengal
yet we are comfortable with turkey.
its how rose 2 power in afghanistan. us dollars via the pakistan int service
should sever all links to this throwback country.

not when they were busy tangling ussr in afghanistan. they would have barked but stopped
fatal warning to from the white house. the mirages went back after entering indian skies
heard was so scared they nearly shot down their own f16 thinking it is israeli. lol
western business interests. they allowed 2 do as they will wi no real condemnation
we also saved from india although they were committing genocide in bengal
. and who also sponsor those who carry out terrorist atrocities
you should have bombed anyway, though
and probably seen bomb us then much more possible these days though
i thought it was that was not fully committed to the operation ? ie they feared pakistani backlash
us and build to destroy afghanistan, then freedom fighter became terrorists or for middle east.

so what that is their misguided interpretation
you equating being nasty to murder ?
so true they will use it for all it is worth
i do not get that quote ?
before this many repeated attacks against muslims in also, sweden, over 20 killed
thats the whole point of free speech, and its much better than oppression and murder
has freedom of speech ‚Äú got anything to do with living in a democratic society ?
they are not ' controversial cartoons ' they are merely ' cartoons '.
what was the argument again ? i think i must have missed that part
training meaning fireworks.
that will help no end.
i and these are mine. this is how twitter works.
its stupidity to attack people who are not at all related to the crime.
yes and the likes of garage will use it to fuel the hate.

i welcome bringing pals to icc. pals have propaganda. israel has facts proof
i condemn hatred and promoting fake info
these events are carried not caused by individuals. the major wheeler dealers are the cause.
a convenient event for murderers to justify their killing of the palestinians.
i choose the people that do not put their own as shields
so do i. i also condemn u fanatical headcases.
killed 160 kids digging terror tunnels. per palestinian research. they kill their own kids !!
bodies in could be from syria too
you are right. would be the first time
it was that did the killing are you mentally vacant ?
come on look what you are doing to the palestinianstalk about hypocrisy !
absolute lunatic. opinion worthless after that. another extremists
no ethnic cleansing of pals. no bodies. lots of lies. even arabs know that.
i support the people arabs are dumb and crazy
all on the payroll means not really journalists
uses hospital as military base. war crime
says the war criminals. if you acknowledged international law you would soon find yourself in the hague
is lebanese iranian do not like it here then go home
your deluded just as fanatical as any muslim. at least they claim there attacks. u lie
so basically you are supporter
the fact you excuse murder of children deny blame says it all. should defend icc no prob
pals use mosques as military base & amp ; weapons storage. war crime
1. did not 2. check facts for real info on pals murdering children.
17 journalists killed in by israel in 2014
illegal weapons targeting of un schools/shelters ethnic cleansing slaughter of children
has evidence of illegal weapons targeting of school un shelters etc
has evidence of workers helping haas terrorists. unschools were hamasrocket site
so why attempt to block access to icc. it a moron a fanatic deluded
the fact that you deny is what is funny and pathetic.
yes the bombed themselves with airplanes that they leased from the if
pal militants dress like civilians when attacking. war crime
more like the other way around
pals target restaurants. war crime
all i hear now is la and lady la
pa rep to admitted pals do war crimes not israelis.
no wonder you will not learn, truth is offensive 2 those who hate the truth
many many losses. go away you fanatic. either condemn all these horrific actions or not
what is the relevant between the 2 ? r u stupid or something ?
so stupid. try some truth for change. see what real journalist say about pals terror
you mean the pally to themselves
i am against any unjust murder no matter what religion. sad you chose racist bias
excuse murder of children really ?
you people have concept of truth. more fanatical than the fanatics
what are they doing defending themselves ? against rocket fire
so what is if doing to combat isis ?
actually. but do not let that get in the way of a good story.
when i criticism terror i do not get attacked by any muslims
sure. link a few of those tweets.
yet you reply. nice try
pals use children as shields. war crime
not anything that is done is also seen

charlie hebdo demanded cartoonist sine apologize for anti-semitic satire then fired him for refusing to do so
. held satirized and judaism :
his violently character certainly played a role as well
excellent question. or ... chosen for what ?
... demeaning or that is a really minute problem compared to the violence
no double standard here after all israel is god is chosen.
think its more likely you are just another white bigot tba ... bye
something is wrong with mm is visual presentation. might this be a false flag ?
the case of sine is more complex. his firing was due to longstanding political disagreements with editorial team
of course not. that is antisemitism.
. nil nisei bonus goes double for white racists
no articles that i know of
so its freedom of speech to insult christianity and islam but not judaism ? hmmm.
it was regarding president is son, think that might have been a factor at all ?
law did not agree that comment was antisemitic, judged that firing sine was an error
i thought that might be at play ... are there any articles about this ?

thats actually what the constitution does when its enforced but its not enforced by cops, judges,
one sure answer is upcoming constitutional convention term limits take out manchurian candidates

the constitution seems to have been taking an awful beating, lately ...
maybe if someone had been armed, 12 people would not have died today.

it is very disappointing to read about journalists objecting to the freedom of expression :

are you really still surprised at racism/xenophobia from followers of ?
you people follow him as well ? trolls can follow him to make him look bad means nothing
it does not help when politicians pile into such arguments when the full context is not known.
you might also like to acquaint yourself with the duties of a man under the law
in many submission is placed above freedom. submission rules everything there.
so being a hypocrite then
the double speak mentality of our day is astounding. who is had believed media defense of islamist murderers
get over your self not everyone who follows nigel are skip or fans simply trolls
lawyer to celebrity fascists
you might like to look at how the uk reacted to my free speech re mi6 funding al ada
you people love spouting bullshit do not you, the fact is people do not listen and thank god
yet you comment and hang on every word he says ?
keep a public list of journalists who offend them
you will have no objection to me saying you are a fuck-eyed sack of piss, then ?
i have been doing that for years. fight on we must.
says the bloke who got upset at a game made by a bunch of school kids

you really should mind your own business and stop talking about other religions and keep focused on yours
you have no right to post or to draw such a picture
west is very good about expressing over fleas, but not about ridding itself of cancer.
forget the dead ones and think about many more that will be killed fool
dog do not talk about our religion or prophet
if that is your retaliation then you are no different from them
hell is a invention. check your history.
and not one of them would dare disrespect a religion like you did
groom your knowledge then talk about our prophet
this is not your religion so keep out of it
this picture is very offensive to muslims
and apparently you have no respect
he was a warlord. not a man of peace. he be-headed jews.
at first i thought this said ‚Äú jesus charlie ‚Äú and i was really confused

c fuck you.
first we are off topic and second there is something called persuasion
my belief is that it is wrong but also i should not offend it
you might think that are bad ? no they are not all bad
actually it is mustard but then i am a satirist.
no i am not. stop using taqiyya. u were born to think islam is great üòÇ
even when you think they are wrong
shut the fuck idiot.
main faith needs to be removed from mosques then. that is why islamic states legalize child rape.
no need to argue with you. think about the dead ones.

more mentally ill people crazy enough to think they are muslim.
you say that hell is an invention but for me it is real and it exists in many religions
in which state child rape is legalized islam condemns all types of rape
you reason from your anus that is why you can not see the deadly problems coming from islamic extremists
in there are a lot of uneducated children that do unspeakable things in the name of their survival

you are such a disgraceful person
i thought i was the only one
like i said there are many ways what if they were a little uneducated
this is what wanted and they will get more. keep supporting islamic extremists and you get this
u are totally misguided about islam
you would let a child be sacrificed for a religion ?
and under sharia you are allowed to marry little girls like muhammad did.
i say this because i do not even know what century they were in but anyways
u baster how u dare to draw
there is a way to stop them but not by making fun of their beliefs or offending them
and that gives you the right to insult religions ?
first of all i am not letting anything
. what about child sacrifice to quetzalcoatl. legitimate religion ? you must respect all religions.

well then they are being hypocrites by publishing images of themselves holding up signs.

typical posh boy all wind no water. ‚Äù but does he carry a gun ?
thanks brother. i respect afc myself and felt they were very unlucky last season.
that is a bad translation from hebrew. it is thou shalt not murder.

it is those who are angry, frustrated, hopeless & amp ; lost who are easily manipulated.
random violence begetting random violence = escalation of violence

i see. tell me how is it possible to insult someone who supports her own enemy ?
pen is going to create the right antigen coalition in the up, using putin is financing.
personal insults lessen your how many votes did her party get at last election ?

you can not fix a problem if you will not recognize it as a problem.
funny how that works.
the condemnation of ideological liars cannot be relevant

why is terror in quotes ?

i know that. it was hyperbole.

we are to the masters who only care to exploit us by race/ religion/ class warfare by ruling class
have you heard of fort hood ???
regardless i will take my leave in discussing this further, have a good day
they arrested him on unrelated charges and never commented on him inciting violence.
problem is disarmed.
i am with you it was a premeditated attack
it is is mindless incoherent trolling often leads to confusion.
the question is will tell france to exercise restraint ?
leaders today give deception to make lies sound truthful, thieves look respectable, media appear show solidity
when does blame the weapons that were used and call for the disarming of france ?
17 journalists massacres by israel in gaza , 2014 . where were these " freedom of speech " people then
do you always misrepresent what people have said ?
i see now where you were coming from. thanks for clarifying jenny
i was asking. i think you misinterpreted my tweet.
i hope you understand what i am trying to explain.
okay as long as you realize that is exactly what you did in this instance
but can you see how your tweet looked like a misrepresentation of what was said by moe ?
please let is not play atrocity fucking top trumps
i will give you benefit of the doubt, its possible i did misinterpret.
the this is not about them !
not sure how you drew that conclusion from that .....
no democracy and no religion. period neither.
the ones i know were marching for palestine. tagedies do not trump one another.

you think it is ok that islamist kill people because of this ?
- paris media attack kills 4 cartoonists including chief editor .

killers can claim their reward from ayatollahs. fatwa rescinded or still in force ?
media attack kills 4 including chief editors.
methinks this is just the beginning ... the gates of hell are opening.
cartoonists do not deserve death for artwork . but i am not . their racist content does not become courageous
power dynamics are pretty important and recreating stereotypical images of marginalized groups are racist.
that is why prophets look like christian bale in hollywood but reduced to stereotype when satirized '
yes just seeing that one !
he was extremely brave and ppm should focus on him and not the cartoons !
you do not seem to see very much
that is not good satire.
when did i say any of that ??? kim, you are tripping.
they can. but they were not in this case.
maybe but they talk about real causes like that.
it is mocking a religion that has been largely socialized in imperialist/islamophobic policies and western secular discourse
sorry but they were just libra denser. they were not racist or sexist they just criticize stereotype.
and the way they portrayed the nigerian women protesting chick girls missing was just tasteless
routine racist police terror against muslim immigrants in the paris projects ?
did you see their drawing ? these are not stereotypes.
that is a stretch. those particular cartoons were not inherently ‚Äú racists ‚Äú.
yeah but everybody is not oppressed in similar ways so i have never liked that excuse they give
i do not see a ‚Äú racist agenda ‚Äú to oppress muslims with this particular cartoon.
no i did not. you said these cartoons are not inherently racist
we are the held cartoons anti-islamic ? did they specifically normalize oppressive policies towards muslims ? no !
i am talking specifically about the caricatures of muhammad. they were not racist. offensive ? yes.
when have you ever heard me praise the merits of free markets ? stop kim
that was an image of a black french politician.
satire is meant to comfort the afflicted and afflict the. they were racist af.
just actually looked at those cartoons. racist and awful.
whoa you just misquoted me to get a couple it's and fans wow !!!!
i understand they are offensive and display the culture insensitivity but how is it ‚Äú racist ‚Äú ?
i am slightly concerned that people clearly do not understand what ' racism ' is
it is insensitive and offensive to people who are offended not racist

i have seen one national newspaper pixelate out the cover of charlie hebdo - the self-censorship begins . terrorists 1
i have seen it and feel : disgusting and shameful.
do you believe that individuals from the muslim faith and islam itself should be immune from satire ?
it is the choice how to react. satire and mockery are part of our culture.
learn what satire is. is not a race. you can not be an extreme secularist.
maybe they are afraid of being killed by the religion of peas.
religion amp the religious, particularly extremists deserve mockery & amp ; ridicule. free speech
good chance of it. there was certainly no blurring of the pics of a crucifix in urine.
do you believe that & amp ; islam should be able to react violently if offended ?
no. did not realism this was an inquisition
bullshit. watch the movie life of brian.
this is part of the problem. you define enlightenment as deliberately provoking muslims beliefs as mockery
do not get a special pass to not be offended.
murdered for free speech ; & gt ; pixels out charlie held front cover. shameful cowards.
name and please. right away.
but we need to live together in peace and respect. deliberately insulting muslims does not help
do you believe that people from other cultures should be able to ridicule muslims & amp ; islam ?
think what you i am clear about what i believe.
i wish i was surprised. shameful.
so they died for nothing ?
i do not call on jews to be insulted. what is your point
but satirists have the right to, yes ?
of course but we should not lionize those who deliberately insult muslims as so called satirists
begins with t ends in h
let me guess does it begin with g and end with n
as soon as you added the word ' but ' to your sentence you became a terrorism apologist.
begins with t ends in h
cowards the terrorists win !
and yet you the name of that newspaper ? link please
r part of now. attack today is disgusting but this so-called satire is just anti muslim
for what purpose why ridicule muslims and islam ? why not treat them without ridicule or mockery
the extremists will benefit from an escalation , it justifies them . people who just want to coexist are thrown
that starts when the people who want to coexist stop taking their beliefs seriously and actually attempt it
please this to the people standing behind heater under the pretense the madman is actually fighting terrorism !
it is not silent just want you to know that
we are is push back bus. extrmists benefit from section. ppl who coexist thrown under bus

hey kid of watch your filthy mouth, fuckers killing the name of allah
maybe it was not the cartoons of mohamed that upset them ?
first mistake we all did was to allow these creepers to grow on our lands.
hilarity
since your freedom has no limits, you have to face the consequences favorably.
blocked and reported for threatening physical harm
freedom of killing notice your ugly tongue.
stop this secular at least not now
listen pig says the follower of the religion of ‚Äú peace ‚Äú

something we have learned from your freedom of speech.
you just and we do. deeds talk.
this does not reflect their policy at all.

that is some white image.

reports of an explosion at a kebab shop close to a mosque near lyon . no indication of link to

never embraced science or capable of engaging in industrial revolution. just a commodity society
everyone says the gunman is dead at the market. there were 2. are they both dead ?
4 hostages were killed out of 15-20 hostages at grocery store.
we know about ancients through greek and jewish eyes. west archaeologists uncovered lost societies. ie hit

1st they came for the jews . then they came for the jews again & amp ; again ... then
this is a good day to keep your muslim agenda to yourself
complete disregard for the facts of history. its always the jews. sometimes others also but always.
takes a certain gall to defend your claim of victim hood as innocent jews are being held hostage.
i but what does that have to do with a conversation about the present day ?
the only thing left to do is wait for iran to finish their nuclear weapons program, right ?
because history is rife with periods when the gays/blacks/etc. had it easy in europe.
oh so are not only violent but also stupid ?
. its greatest sages who called zionism an abomination and threat to world jewry.
yeah right you piece of trash
what do the of paris have 2 do with israelis & amp ; ur zionist logic ?
the greatest peril for is thinking that nobody is going to respond.
how i wish this was not true.
looks like we just sent two more pieces of pork back to good riddance
time to clean up shop. rid the of this cancer !
hence my trouble with people trying to claim first prize for the jews.
the human race will be much better place without neo-nazi is like you
hence my trouble with people trying to claim first prize for the jews.
but this is not a contest in suffering
. well when stop equating judaism with zionism, world jewry would be in much better place
so 3 put down. good riddance. they are being raped by now. lol

guess it shows that this has always been an issue 4 political cartooning -ability to mock is important
i did think it was extraordinarily speedy. but hey, the point stands

do u condemn any of the things mohammad done in his life ?
ukip is culture spokesman : freedom is the very bedrock of western democracy . it is non-negotiable .
freedom that is being taken away by the powers that be every day.
it is not
ed and dates row about hhs today was all written down in advance word for word
unless you are a hardworking immigrant seeking freedom to travel.
yes that is why we arrest people for reading from a winston churchill book.
our freedom in the west embodies some disrespect for other cultures. we must strive to counter this.
with that comes the respect for our rule of law, culture and language
a lefty then its part of the plan
this is why i and other muslims will not apologise for the charlie hebdo attacks ‚Äì
wherever you like that has decent beer. do not fuck off after 45 mind.
in some but we are more alike in these areas than we realize.
there was a recent amp ; extremely ridiculous example with fox news - a separate incident.
i am taking this as a win by the way ‚Ä¶
win knock yourself out.
i think we all agree that is wrong then. us must be very diff to uk.
and yes if something heinous was done in my name i would take to the streets if outrage.
to condemn and to apologize are two different things. i think these are being confused in this piece
majority publicly condemn those ores. no one expects apologies. pointless article
exactly nobody said anything about apologizing. its about condemning the actions. its a noticeable silence
i have not slept for 28 hours. im actually going bed now.
condemning every act of violence would also be a full time job for anyone ...
fried was done in my name ?
i would have thought everybody is obligated by to condemn the murder of journalists ...
looks like a ) conflation of mass outrage/condemnation and apology ...
was it i must have missed something. when/where did the perpetrators say that ?
sod this. what are you doing next thursday ?
not to mention the numerous local talk radio shows across the usa.
denouncement and apology are vastly different things, confused by this article. interesting read though.
fair but i have not seen any anchor calling for that !
i agree. if this was the case, then everyone would need to apologize all the time.
it would be pointless if we did not have ‚Äú news anchors ‚Äú on air calling for such nonsense
so you were out on the streets when abe fried broke ?
i am a muslim journalist . although i disagree w/ anti-islam cartoons , my faith compels me to respect the
i would like if re-tweeted cartoons to show true condemnation and support of the free press
glad you are able to make this all about you.
your first obligation is to be ‚Äú tired ‚Äú of islamic terrorism itself.
condemning means talking about the reality of islamic violence on behalf of your slain journalist colleagues.
you are not condemning. you are bragging about your superior ethics.
you are thinking of an ' opinion '. you can not disagree with an idea.
in fact openly complaining or remarking on islamic terrorism puts a person at risk for revenge murder.
but can you have an intellectual as well as civil chat about the violent trends within islam itself ?
really are all the ‚Äú christians ‚Äú as ‚Äú segregationist ‚Äú ?
you should perhaps place your frustration at terrorism and not a muslim condemning terrorism.
show your own condemnation then by re tweeting political cartoons. lead by example.
exactly the impression i got susan.
no. people mainly complain about islamic terrorism. the muslim reactions to it are secondary complaints.
1 of the cops killed at was , like most victims of islamist militants , a muslim .
strictly prohibits killings of innocents and appreciates forgiveness. u he wrong info
coincidentally enough. most victims of israeli & amp ; us attacks are also muslims
this is not this is extremism and secularism ,my heart goes out to their families
they were two moustapha our rad and ahmed mere.
of descent indeed. but it does not imply anything about his faith.
are most likely victims of any militants
really pity so many think killing innocents in his name is not just allowed but encouraged then.
... sends his regards ...
call them just call militants or terrorists. islam does not allow this.
was no pacifist like the nazarene, and his followers are still as bloodthirsty.
charlie hebdo was not singling out islam . it is target was authority , whatever its source . via
where did you get your education ? are you an even real doctor ?
that makes absolutely not one bit of sense.
its. oh even the new york times can not tweet without basic errors.
the deliberately was seeking out journalists because of their cartoons. you are an idiot.
hey it should say its ‚Äú, not ‚Äú it is ‚Äú !
reputation of once again under threat as paris comes under attack
if you only knew the actual crimes that your tax dollars pay for
perhaps the times could illustrate this by actually publishing the work of charlie held.
the new times can not even use ‚Äú its ‚Äú correctly.
i have supported through the entire war. i know.
a variation on question authority ‚Äú
please re tweet that without the stray apostrophe.
why would they defend your brothers in isis ?

the border force covers airports too

the magazine attacked in paris has a history of bold satire
the magazine did go too far with their racism dressed up as satirical publishing but is inexcusable
may have pushed the limits of satirical humor but that was their right in a free society !
let us never forget and stand strong with the staff of and media throughout the free world.
it is easy to condemn killings . it is harder to say unequivocally that we have the right to depict
your rules are hurting whole world
so terrorists sold be allowed set the boundaries for free speech ?
i did not tell them to shut up either
if you have nothing good to say than shut up
i am blocking one for hypocrisy the other for pomposity
i do not think these people do these things for any other reason than they want to
for the record dispute their right to tell us what we have the right to do.
really. so u do feel that terrorists sold be allowed set the limits for free speech
thats why leaders should play role
been up and down your time line, can not find your views on charlie held
you could well be right but do not need to listen to them
telling those with whom you disagree to shut up is the epitome of ending discussions
no. if you do not like what we tweet then follow us.
so point out that this appears to be being used as an excuse to murder
are find almost immediately that they are not wholly banned.
just because they say we should
and they choose this in order to give themselves the pretext
your attitude is a very reason of extremism growing.
do you mean my attitude ?
that they choose to do this because they choose to be offended.
i told them to stop spreading hat erred on social media, with me i am here for discussion
no you did you told them to shut up.
to which i would suggest you follow them if u do not want to listen to them
my attitude is to respect the beliefs of others but not to accept their dogma.
why follow discussion should not end

unfortunately you are right. armed forces are not armed (only taker guns) . üòî
just one of the terrorist do not make all us like them. like killers.
the idiot then accused me of sympathizing with extremists. so i blocked him.
yeah the killers even stated it was while killing. this was revenge for moe.
remember this is nothing to do with religion. bollocks.
. these guys do not give a damn about.
sorry but they are all the same, the only good muslim is a dead 1
me neither. but they call upon allah. just like muslims.
this is from corn coz these assholes do not know about that
i do not know who they are to be honest.

surprisingly all terrorists invoke do you think they are buddhists or catholics ?!
yes honey it is in corn üòî because this iii saythey are not mmuslim.
then why do they say they have avenged their prophet ? of course they are muslims

exactly what i was albeit a split second before they kill everyone else.

i deleted my suggestion that paris attacks be blamed on us drones , when it became apparent that even that
have you considered and researched the ideals of a mass murder are his own ...
what is a matter race ?
you clearly do not get it
consider this tho he did
he was using catholicism to create the matter race ....
little known was also an era
you must have people among your followers that willfully misunderstand everything you say ...
historians agree that lost the war because of his atheism
fucking idiot could not find evidence supporting ururtatement
he was .... born and raised ....
being in denial does not mean you won ....
you cited a you have zero room to laugh
i learned something today. the more you know *
is all about creating a matter-taddee
obviously. what other reason could there be ? saint ding dong () is infallible.
now you are really getting twitter
yes any good atheist knows he belongs to the religion of hitler
that is fine but your wrong ...
i barely engaged either of you two and you flooded my mentions i won
a lot of struggles to come to terms that killed for
it does not. killing millions for is sick, bub
an educator you switched your ‚Äú e ‚Äú and ‚Äú a ‚Äú
he was an atheist
why you gotta be so rude ?
or maybe you just suck at it ?
you can deny it all you like he was christian ...
opposed organized religion. but he did believe in god.
camp ... translates to ‚Äú my struggle ‚Äú .....
a u have a meme as supporting evidence ? seriously
for once i agree with you.
you can deny all you like he was atheist
while we are at have i responded to you yet ?
or maybe the people who can not see the sarcasm are just unimaginably stupid ?
for stupidity knows no bounds.
this can only be settled with dueling downfall videos. go !
its true. this was all outlined in man camp (which literally means my unbelief)
common misconception. was definitely atheist
why are you calling professor hawkins st. ding dong ? i do not understand ?
and thus photo is a fake ....
he was find some other arrangement ...
ha ha aha ... at least spell it rights : atheist
what evidence do u have supporting this, jd ?
.... if it helps ya sleep better ...
adjusts fedora he was atheist
he was referring to himself
native speaker those buckles read ‚Äú god is not real ‚Äú. common mistranslation
he thought he was a god according to this meme. therefore it does not support the theory.
you have to reality tv is worse than anything ever inflicted upon the world
.... there is plenty of historical evidence to prove it ...
oh the master race of ya, agreed.
why are you being so disrespectful ? professor hawkins is a leading figure in the natural sciences.
i do not believe you won this one. have a nice day
killing millions is wrong .... but we differ on his motivation ...
why would an atheist kill jews ?
actually your sucks .... is says good it is with us ...
no pivotal evidence ... it is photographic evidence ....
we refer 2 it as a ‚Äú m√ºllerk√∂rnerkleft ‚Äú, meaning only atheists we disagree
won what the quiet game ?
that is cool. there is no sin for lying in so you are permitted to lie
was this is fact ....
why will not atheists just accept hitler was one of them ? embrace it
have you considered that maybe he did not ?
are you freaking robot is atheist some kind of inner word ??
in response to another yes
or maybe the people who can not see the sarcasm are just unimaginably stupid ?
indeed he did was atheist
it was easy to see that professor hawkins was being sarcastic. you - not so much.
it does not support he was atheist either ...
just an was an atheist, now you know
i do not think you should be talking about a sense of humor
and this guy says i have bad grammar. hitler was an atheist pal, deal with it
was using catholicism as a smokescreen to do genocide in the name of
i just baited all you think about it
. the problem with obvious sarcasm is that people are willfully stupid.
was now with your bullshit.
it is probably a new nazi page
look away all you want atheists, you can not deny the facts
that was a false statement made up to decorate him from christianity ...
no stated that his ‚Äú conduct is in accordance with the will of the almighty creator ‚Äú
that is false information .... he did not ...
why are you re tweeting the np ?
obviously. there are two reality programs currently airing that deal with the problem of reality tv
st. does that work better for you ?
a bunch of atheist what is your point ?
wrong. was a roman catholic. the nazis had got mitt us etched into their belt buckles
he was not.

one can condemn the killings , while conjointly condemning racism , xenophobia , and islamophobia framed as harmless cartoons .
why condemn satire everything should be fair game.
published cartoons satirizing all the major religions not only islam. how is that islamophobia ?
dichotomous thinking is not my cup of tea ...
this really is not hard concept2parse unless ur a racist, xenophobic asshole who also traffics in islamophobia.
makes me wonder if the artists at were really left wing in their politics.
by adding your disclaimer that the cartoons are improper you are supporting the view of the savage killers.
why do you not comment on the fact jews and catholics were also a subject of their satire ????.
condemn an entire worldwide religion based on the actions of a few. all faiths have extremists.
latest from printworks where suspects had taken one hostage .
why are your cameramen laughing ???

things seem to be hotting up
. latest from print works where suspects had taken one hostage.
support and show islamists we wont be scared . pls retweet the most offensive cartoons !!
done. up yours and any other muslim bitch who does not like it.
its satire disgusting or not its meant to shock and be seen as a joke.
if our so called journalist wont do it at least we can
and i would not wish to print those pics either - but would not stop others from doing so
so true fortunately we now the net
i am gonna re tweet. dear isis : bring it, bitches.
because being deliberately offensive is such a great way to celebrate freedom of speech
you do not have a right not to be offended
how about this for horrible. . . . . .
these are not cartoons they are news bulletins !

yeah because in country girls are even scolded for watching men football !! retard !
hey retard how you got info that there were no terrorist in mosque ?
sigh grenades thrown at mosque in france, day after attack : officials ‚Äú
what about mahasabha, beijing day
good start of against muslims/islam
what about grenades thrown at mosque
i salute if singulars in india had same courage then india would have been terrorist free
grenades thrown near the mosque not inside mosque. this is too done by muslims
very unfortunate and act of coward
i guess will be very proud now
terrorist attacked in name of religion and killed innocent people while police retaliated to capture those terrorist !!
harm what religion do they belong mr. retard ??
here is a rundown of the cartoons the savages in paris just slaughtered 12 people over :
coming from who stated buddy is where right to break the law.
repent from worshiping and turn to the lord jesus christ
radical terrorists who kill us for simply being americans. find who is
endearing themselves to the world again.
until they kick their butts out of their country this will keep happening.
it should result in millions more cartoons created.
the pressure on nations to enact serious, visible reforms, shut radical mosques, etc.
they only understand violence. and they are cowards.
i do not have a kind of terrorism do you ?
copy he knows how to deal with these savages.
i was trying to stress the importance of not labeling all muslims as
. you cannot win a war by simply proclaiming moral superiority to your enemy
these these people who do this have lost their humanity.
well bob you said it special kind of stupid
. you must be thinking about genocide. i never said it.
now you are just stretching the buddy supporters were peaceful until attacked
who is bald down the middle. the middle age mullet low
if we kill people because of their faith then we are no better then the
amp then there is brain in norway. he is a muslim ; right ?
i am using a marine generals saying. please do not make me pull my weapon please
it was peaceful who blew up the ok fed building.
sorry sir i was in a bunch of conversations yesterday
but what do you do to stop this ?
are you serious i am not responsible for anything these animals do
you can accept responsibility if you choose to but i do not will do whatever
thanks for clearing it out. prayers go to the families of the 12 victims.
but so far it is been peaceful muslims reeking this kind of havoc
any radical terrorists would be a better term i suppose. and yes wipe them off earth
us in eliminating these radicals. i think it is going to take everyone to say that is enough
does that include should we b prosecuting john derby shire for instance ?
when radical drunken sailors cause this kind of mayhem you can include them
it takes a special kind of stupid to make a statement like that
u are no different from those who find hydro acceptable. only different ideology.
right only kind of terrorism is acceptable !
there is nothing more viciously intolerant than a pony-tailed professor.
no sir you can not. but that is no excuse for genocide either.
just want to make my point that being muslim does not make you a radical
you could just call them terrorists then. any religion is just a way to claim power.
you are aptly named for your orwellian thinking. you have not a clue what i think
maybe not on all just the ones that read the duran
if you do though i will wipe you and your party off the face of this earth
it is not religion or offending belief its barbaric, inhuman acts of terrorism. thoughts with the families
amp do not forget those peaceful clive buddy supporters who shot 2 cops in nv.
there is a distinct difference in accepting and resisting
not blaming all i am blaming those muslims who killed 12+ people in paris today.
do not kill them of their faith kill ' em bcuz they kill us
just like liberal tolerance. they love you ... as long as you agree with everything they say.
please do not use hurtful words. it is great to be able to debate
you are responding to the wrong person. should be responding to.
the moderate runs interference, spreads dis info, supports, and defends the radical.
and the guilty parties are paying for the crime bcuz we americans did not accept it
yes sir. death to those who threaten innocent lives
is necessary to prevent this form happening
why assume the problem should be all muslim responsibility - we are all responsible
they bombed subway and have committed 1000s of other attacks including on their own people
sad khartoon ! i am just a muslim .. from a muslim rip

how is that an insult ?
surely they are doing the best they can ?
are not ' playing the victim ' ‚Äì the far-right are calling all innocent muslims terrorists.
verbal condemnation is no longer sufficient. they must act. fast.
whats the common theme with all these terrorist ? islamic leaders should stay away. protest against this later
yet this attacks are increasing in frequency
you are a disgraceful bigot.
a very dangerous minority that must be stopped

i do not want to preach hate against any group - including muslims.
yeah i am familiar with them.
no. it is evidence that extremists exist. nothing more.
ha ha ha you are shitting yourself in fear.
if peaceful do they should be very pissed at the terrorists.
that is a big part of it. we should also stop killing innocent people.
pretty sure that is not exactly what meant.

update police storm kosher grocery store in eastern paris as reports of suspects killed ‚Äù
analysis : the story of the police officer killed in the attack is no longer in the headlines - why
not anymore. tension towards would ease otherwise.
the redheaded chick with the one liners
the article is flawed by the fact that ahmed megabit was the last person to be killed
because a life does not equate to anything in the eyes of the west sad but fact
maybe it is because there is another shooting going on ? stop being paranoid.
in i have heard more about him than several of the others who were murdered at
i have seen several times where he was mentioned. and photos of him.
exactly why should i give a shit swallow !
signs of the infidels. they can not stop islam. blame
sad interesting to see interview with jeannette bougrab- her algerian father sided with france

fuck the bigger hypocrites than the americans.
what can we expect from ‚Äú our esteemed ally ‚Äú who beheads women for sorcery ? '
so you are saying satires on politicians was wrong
the holocaust actually involved people dying. there is no comparison to be made.
double standard of trouble makers
same as avoided holocaust cartoons but prophet cartoons were
offend is your right.
the worst hypocrisy of world when it comes to freedom of expression and democracy !!
r the root cause of all the turmoil
published deaths people dying. saudi has blasphemy laws.
did they satirist deaths ? blasphemy laws are a complete joke.
the holocaust was real. god is not.

even leaders from have started saying this. see this :

are they trying to convince themselves ?
also applies to the left in canada !

amp that of liberal journalists in india too like et. al
secular response to rabid what an oxymoron.
that is media list you stole !
then what the fuck is it ? it is a pure and simple islamic terrorism
religious people are mostly mentally unstable. religion is a collective neurosis as freud said
how to respond to the murderous attack on charlie hebdo ? every newspaper in the free world should print this
because they have to learn to not be offended, that is why.
and neither am i i think this has little to do with actual muslims.
if people insult something that is important to you, you feel that your identity is under attack.
oh dear ... just saw those tweets ... blocked him.
it is remarkable how quickly they come out the woodwork.
just for the record. i am not in any way, shape or form defending this atrocity.
until it becomes yours.
remind me when was the last time jews bombed the guardian.
also they kid you along with benign stuff then ... wham it is like a river of white !
label anyone they do not like as anti-semite and campaign until that person/company is finished.
and if that is the case, that is your problem.
you do not like jews. bye bye.
why insult people who have nothing to do with this ? people are genuinely offended by such drawings.
there is a lot of very dodgy twitter accounts who seem benign then you see the real side
i know gives me the creeps.
from 2011 : france is charlie hebdo newspaper has long reveled in the art of provocation
so basically the not is saying ‚Äú they deserve it ‚Äú ... nice ...
shame on times how about you support free speech and stand against intolerant islam
. so a cartoon is provocation for mass murder ? i guess in islamic thinking it is.
can you appeasement monkey coward fascists be even slightly respectful of free speech, even today ?
one thing will never be taken from charlie hebdo : courage
where is your courage today ? where are the cartoons ?
this rt one thing will never be taken from charlie held : courage
one thing will never be taken from charlie held : courage.
get real bull he is dead. this ai not a movie
one thing held needs : respect
one thing held needs : stop inciting hate. it is not funny at all.

how do you slander a false prophet ?
the solution is not with moderate muslims. there must be massive propaganda reeducating everyone on islam.

yes. fanatics. but they recite duran daily from 1st day if schhol-college

stop lying this attack was nothing to do with free speech
jews , catholics , muslims , white people , black people . everyone attacked by charlie hebdo , yet who
let me give you a clue, do you think brainless violence justifies more brainless violence ?
you want to justify the killing as if the journalists killed muslims.
do you know who did it ?
then what were you trying to say with the tweet ?
i am not trolling at all. there will be no peace until we send these people packing
hopefully a it is shock therapy.
do i can you support that defamation with evidence ?
i slipped the other day and hurt myself ...... i had no option but to blame the jews.
lets be friends instead !
no. do you think one leads to the other ?
just hope my god is not your god
police action is arguably top down, that is the appropriate response to this crime
the reason you can not find evidence is that your statement was a complete and brainless lie
they would react the same even if the west pulled out of every islamic country.
cheers. times like this when libertarians distinguish themselves fm bigots.
ad nominee will not safe you now. you wanted proof.
why are some people of this faith so afraid of criticism that they react to violence each time ?
so you withdraw your lie that i was ‚Äú justifying ‚Äú or in any way supporting the attack.
certainly makes more sense than a ‚Äú libertarian ‚Äú advocating top-down/governmental action.
if you feel ashamed by what another jew does, you are doing it wrong.
oh god let us hope so.
that is one thing as a very clear matter of fact, is untrue.
yeah like the 10 innocent people that have been killed
which libertarian is doing that ? in what context ?
it is repeated invasions that were the problem
how dare anyone blame ... it is the jews ... or the hindus ?
no he means attacked by the magazine. as in satirized
leave me alone if you are all mad, but i am not letting you get the last word
if you genuinely want to engage with people you need to go about it differently.
they are pretty !
sorry i misread it. my foolishness.
knew news corp be the first to react like that

who followers of religion of peace
it does look as though i was right.
but that is trolls for you. they find a way to destroy what you love.
maybe justifying was indeed the wrong word. trying to reason the attack is what i meant.
it just seems you were trying to give a reason for the attacks.
nice to see a libertarian ‚Äú advocating community/ group responsibility.
none that i know of. that would be nonsense.
how do you know who was attacked ? or who the attackers were.
just a troll then. good good.

did not know journalists killed them. thanks for head- oh wait you are a shit.
you are exposing you are state of mind, not mine.

no more all said. you are clearly a moron.
what are you trying to say ?
so aggrieved by the truth on twitter bye emma make some rachel corrie pancakes for breakfast
then how can i possibly have been ‚Äú justifying ‚Äú the attack ?
do you mean the invasion by muslims into european countries ?
should get the hell out
try now the middle east will go. into denial mode. will blame jewish conspiracy.

just as who claim to be christian but are so only in their own minds
you know ... you may have just stumbled upon our last and only option ...
if we had a leader that was not part of the movement, might b possible.
please publish the cartoons if you do not the muslim terrorists have won this war
faith has never been anything other than something in the person is ‚Äú own mind ‚Äú

at least 12 killed in shooting at office of french satirical : charlie held
at cafe near . liberation says we are all charlie . parisien says they will not kill liberty/freedom .
but corporate sponsored political correctness streamlined to people via the media keeps the muslim cancer growing in europe.
please ask to deny holocaust too ? will it be a part of freedom of expression ?
listen we love our prophet muhammad peace upon him more than our self stop attacking muslim leaders
get serious about and west is double standards on freedom of speech !
who is the zealot and fanatic ?
liberty should have limits not to attack other people prophets
get serious about and west is double standards on freedom of speech !
so happy to see you along with chris.
we all normal descent ppm are charlie.
only this , today
free speech which is offensive and mocks religious figures ? that is not necessary
its not its free speech. i can repeat all i said if you want.
love is stronger than hate ‚Äú rt : only this, today
in a perfect world yes but that will never ever happen
at the same time why give those people ammunition to commit these crimes
free the whole world should have it. very necessary
but it does not seem to be true.
so when these atrocities occur do not complain simple
love is stronger than hate¬ªrt
no it will not but that does not mean people should bow down to what scum want.
rt only today
free speech is free that cartoon wont do any harm. instead condemn the murderers
in what way is this necessary visit every day the media be must provocative
only today ‚Äù just unnecessary tba
remember this ? those men died for our right to freedom of speech . do not let that sacrifice be
this is a great day for those who want us to hate each other.
they could have a field day with the guardian and bbc
just a shame freedom of speech is not accepted by islam ?
i wish they would have done it to our complicit media.
freedom of speech using as freedom of spitting dangerous people, is not very intelligent
freedom look it up in the dictionary it covers everything.
no they died for is freedom of speech.
no they did not.
. i think you should tweet a cartoon of mohammad for the sake of that freedom of speech.
i would not mind seeing being chased round a studio with an ak47 wielding islamic madman
. are those poppies because wwi was not fought for free speech.
i think it is just a piss poor comparison, frankly.
why muslims should embrace free speech , even if it includes insults to their prophet
its not an insult to criticism judaism, only to demonize jews. difference
wow. i do not care. we are specifically talking about not derail !
right free speech is especially important when it is the right to insult
read the article first i have addressed all that
call it freedom of speech ?
embrace freedom of insult u mean ?
its kinda pathetic that they need defending from cartoons after all these years- no ?
i did not. read it properly
i never seen any case muslims insult any religions jew, christian or anything
reality check people in most places dehumanize people different to them.
you were the one trying to justify censorship b/c of colonialism
and there are not examples of imagery in muslim countries that dehumanize others ?
you clearly did not read till the end
does need defending ... we did not make it a monopoly of religion, you did.
... or are you just arguing because that is what you like doing all day ?
so you think colonialism made muslims less tolerant of free speech ?
you mean why extremists should.
... but western countries far more tolerant to diversity than arab or even south asian countries
so that makes it ?
we are done here. well done for not reading or understanding

we have reached peak stupid

why would not the let one of their creations go offs ? lol
i take it you believe in nothing, you have nothing to explain the universe or its origin ?
the bridge go through his empty head ?
i do not even ... rt : we have reached peak stupid
which man made ghost in particular ? haha
i fear we have yet to see the high water mark.
really can you point any examples of tolerant and equitable countries riven by terrorism and radicalism ?
i do not recall reports of socrates or any of his subsequent followers beheading people for not agreeing
quite the opposite a truly equitable and tolerant society is what destroys radicalism.
anyone suspected of peak stupid, indeed
so you like the prejudices ?
if that is not then i do not know what is.
never say things like that ! people take it as a challenge !
not sure what that say about the ridiculous notion of diminishing human right to fight fascism ?
we have many example inequality and intolerance leading an escalation in strife.
used to follow his damon and accepted views of oracles, was he not wise ?
and here is the paper ‚Äú sound familiar ?
yep. exactly what fundamentalists and jihads need to take a full victory.
that was when authoritarians who scapegoated ethnic groups during an economic depression were in power ?.
so you accept that all communities attempt to tyrannize thought and you like yours more than theirs ?
regardless of any penalty ‚Äú jeeeeezzz ....
of any penalty ' - i thought we were meant to be a decent, humane country !
the has hate speech laws and it has a law against treason which includes plotting.
point me to a tolerant and equitable country. none exist that i have seen.
i would like to aspire to be as wise as socrates. would not you ?
that is an unproven assumption that flies in the face of history and human nature.
you prefer your fascism to theirs, is that correct ?
they did not want to be ruled by a tyrant, and he executes them.
would support revoking his human rights after reading this.
think we hit peak stupid in 2010.
all communities try to tyrannize thought.
many of his pupils became tyrants, critics for example executed many athenians.

attempts to extend blame for this to all muslims should be treated with the same disgust as attempts to justify
there must be knowing these criminals. will they talk ?
when will we see mass protests from moderate ' muslims against these killings ? i think highly unlikely
not sure about that anymore ... there is something about the religion that is driving people towards terrorism
of course. but the solution of doing nothing is not working.
then every needs to stand up and say that and stop being silent
most people are blaming mad extremists
are good people and they should find, fight and condemn killers.
it is crazy. video footage will back such claims ...
can we at least assume that these murderers demand and expect the support of all muslims ?

if you are not condemning the ideology that killed 12 at , your sympathy does not mean shit . support
anders brain was and he killed 77 people. but ..... okay ??
it is relevant if it is why they are doing it !
yeah i know besides equating muhammad to allah would be shirk.
which oddly seems very racist to me given the size and composition of islam
pretty fucking simple. you can deny all you want though.
communist infiltrated rt oh communism ... yuck ! fair point.
kitchens ....
i agree. but also do not tell them they are deranged, delusional, or moronic.
well enjoy your sloganeering and your day. i have had enough here.
so you agree that new atheism shares absolutism with religion ?
only after they have killed someone ok ?
there is a wide rage of mental illnesses. not just bipolar.
that is racist ... according to glenn greenland and ben affect.
when it is white they only do it because ‚Äú mental instability ‚Äú
and neither can you. which is the point being made.
will not condemn as islam did not kill.
that is a very dangerous assertion & amp ; diminishes mental instability/illness.
funny how that is not it ?
you do not agree with god you worship him, that is how.
affect not even a good actor
it says verses in the book ... nothing about mohammad.
has affect is opinion changed at all since that appearance ? have not heard anything since.
i do not have access to their psychiatric records, so i can not make that call.
so u think that devout religious imams etc r all right in the head ?
religion is a mental instability.
yes. and his religion was mentioned !
no one hides the fact that xians attack abortion clinics.
confusing racist with ‚Äú bigoted ‚Äú and changing definitions to meet your needs.
it is studying real islam reveals a very twisted and sad religion
when they get to the new atheist place of worship i will
that is your opinion, man[and merriam-webster is. but never mind that now]
me neither. do not think so.
it does not. it highlights what deranged beliefs can do if left addressed
i think he was joking.
they will call you racist !
sounds a pretty thought to me that.
is faith really delusion or just faith about a deity delusion ?
oh it is always white people to blame hey.
if you call them mad or sick you relive them of their responsibility
i do not think you understand how it works very well
you talk to you are religions. god talks to you, you are psychotic. -house
no confusion on my part. bigotry & amp ; racism are synonyms.
guess your history books did not include the communist revolutions then.
is the simple stop teaching religion ?
can you guys until me from this discussion please ?
but i have yet to see an atheist kill someone for their beliefs
they are not. the definitions are almost entirely different.
faith is faith. religion is a whole other thing, and it is religion that kills not faith
but only atheists claim it proves the inherent evil of xtianity
. not a tough decision. i will be against those who support death for cartoonists and apostates.
whereas atheists seem to be in agreement w xians on the ‚Äú inherent evil ‚Äú of islam ...
oh you should check yours if that is what you have read.
that is what i get for ¬´ multitasking ¬ª - just doing two things badly
including the religion of atheism ?
tell your fellow new atheists that, many missed the memo.
sloganeering but still true. have a good day
same intent for all. isolated ? mohammad is ass !
you would not say that to be religious is to be .... oh, bipolar, would you ?
who do they worship as non believers ?
better medicate them all out of it then. problem solved
basically you have just stated everyone who thinks differently than you is deranged.
your racism is pretty funny too
i absolutely can. killing for virgins & amp ; heaven = mental illness.
checks world history book * yup, pretty much
oh communism ... yuck fair point.
in exactly the same way as when christian nutters attack abortion clinics.

the artwork may not be the pinnacle of free speech but the artists certainly are.

of but i asked why you thought these cartoons were regarded as the pinnacle of free speech
your opinion offends me ... i would never expect you not to express it.
proliferating broadly rhetoric only reinforces their recruitment narrative and builds support for terrorism.

i do not think it is illegitimate to find their work racially offensive, even if it is complicated
that is often the response when people are killed for their work.
that is an interesting interpretation of his views.
tricky distinction a broadly anti-racist publication that used gross racial caricatures.
they were unsparing in their attacks on capital-r racists such as the national front ...
i think the right to mock is important, but not through a racist medium.
would not object to anyone saith their cartooning style. vs message, is racially offensive)
what happened was my heart breaks for them and their families. but i would not romanticism
it‚Äôs quite clear that actually admires islam.
should now admires it. )
discriminating. i think they are offensive. i also said i still support their foe
mocking religious piety is always a good thing ! they have bishops buggered by hookers too.
it is a distasteful given to easy stereotype, a guilty pleasure for french hippie left.
his work like most everyone is. freedom of speech works both ways.
do i have to endorse their work because they were killed for it ?
cc they even took on people who were islamophobic and you branded them racist ! shameful
guess now there is reason to be phobic and fearful of islam
calling for reactionary publication of cartoons that stereotype & amp ; profile is still a bad idea.
but looking at the support in germany and sweden. sane voices are there ...
their meaning is often lost without french political context. but right to offend is important

i wish people would wait until they catch and identify them before they go off

if your religion is worth killing for , please start with yourself .
a real one with the deepest thoughts !! deserves rt !
stop making excuses for terrorists . tweeted this before christmas and there will be no avenging jesus .
oh offs that is all we need, another bloody religious war on the horizon !
terrorists are fanatics who seek to avenge insults of muhammad w/violence are paying no heed to the koran.
on the horizon initiated a religious war w/ the slaughter of. not the other way
one thing you can always rely on with pc brigade. arrogance, ego and pomposity in abundance.
so go amp stop it.
so basically you are saying only muslims have the capability of shouting ‚Äú allah akbar ‚Äú ?
maybe the gunmen were christian fundamentalists.
read the bullshit for the next few weeks, then chum
we are down the ‚Äú white supremacist ‚Äú path from you pompous pillocks already ?
sounds about right to these ears !
who is making excuses for terrorists, jonathan ?
i am sure you need directions to the nearest loony bin. turn left at the squiggle
cue the ' lone wolf ' brigade
maybe not the best choice of words.
not my job friend. i just have an opinion is all.
... how about everyone just chill the fuck out ?
utterly disgusting . blaming free speech and berlin protests for attack on
they also support terrorist in syria, no surprise there ...
how journalists can state that must apologize for their challenging content is beyond belief
doing the same ch was ‚Äú brazen and provocative ‚Äú.
said faith can move mountains. you say it is claustrophobic sickness. who should i believe ?
they and is rt crap.
we can always start another hash tag.
some people keep telling me the news is very good and balanced.

live video coverage on their site.
are they i just went on the website and could not see that
still continuing with their veiled questions ‚Äú do you think they crossed a line in their satire ‚Äú
listen to live video coverage on their site.
no matter what or muslims have to play the victim.
is a jihad payroll paper
are good at making things appear balanced. polished british accents tend to do that.
media obsesses over free speech for while ignoring israeli targeting journalists
yeah they throw rocks through wind shields, stab and run over people at train stations
follow or pervert the truth so one can sleep at night ?
depends what you mean by bias.
... i went to the premiere. it was very tough to watch.
to is door by haas firing rockets and refusing to recognize israel is right to exist
i forgot about all that stuff the if does
kills kids or do you need reminding ?
terrorists come in all shapes & amp ; sizes & amp ; religions, including jewish.
it is been fun.
you can not really beat the testimony of someone who was actually there.
obviously. that is why i thought you should be reminded.
wait ... targeting journalists ? he died while pa forces tried to defuse an unexplored ordinance ...
what about threatening journalists for their reporting from gaza during last conflict ?
good for you. i do not respect anyone, even elders, who pervert the truth.
mike some of us actually followed what was going on.
very true. extremists of all beliefs and sizes. but to call an unexplored bomb targeting is dumb
and not by rockets fired by haas that fell short and landed in gaza ?
one and need i remind you where they place launchers ? schools. hospitals.
it was someone who understood the bigger picture. she is made a film actually ...
attack will be biased no matter what ? it is human nature.
i followed people there. in fact i even met a one journalist who lived through it.
i wonder why firing rockets and refusing to recognize israel ?
probably. but watch it. i am old enough to be your mum.
the only murdered journalists were killed by
pinpointing cartoon artists and editors and pulling the trigger is targeting. you guys are morons.
here are some short profiles of the four cartoonists who were killed yesterday at charlie hebdo :

what 14 muslims think about the charlie held attack ‚Äù
the 2011 issue of charlie hebdo , whose cover featured mohammed .
worrisome. any idea why no one is trending
i can not comment on that com i do not understand the language.
goons too broke a few window panes. look, they are all the same
only fools do comment on subjects they do not understand !
now ask amp to make movie based on what exactly written in korean
what is common between jams bond and religion of peace ? license to kill. .
it is cute. seems a happy sort.
the 2011 issue of charlie held, whose cover featured mohammad. ‚Äú
i fail to comprehend if this pic is really worth 11 precious lives ?
madam are you justifying the attack ? shamful

challenge if you can respond. now everyone has understood who is fool ?
will radar declare tax free in up ?

french muslims condemn the charlie hebdo shooting
wrong. a lot of french twitter accounts are celebrating this event.
frankly just as i do not think it is appropriate to offend someone in a # society.
you do not believe who ? the muslims who condemn that attack ?
i saw that ignorance is real
so there is a true problem with this religion and/or culture
as a i never celebrated any death. i even prayed for bin laden is soul
problems always with the person who creates it
no reports on that yet. an explosion was heard near a ‚Äú kebab shop ‚Äú too.
oh wow that is bad. any casualties ?
3 grenades were thrown at a mosque earlier today.
condemn the charlie held shooting ‚Äù
it is still a minority of the total number of muslims
condemn the charlie held shooting ‚Äù ‚ù§Ô∏è
they will kill who get into their way.
how to prevent from obeying radical ? read here :
a kebab is a not a shop. please send me the sources
it is the job of the majority to stop their minority then. not ours.
if that was there would be no idiots in any religion.
thank you mister now can you repeat this in arabic please ?
if this was against or jews there would be a huge uproar.
it has nothing to do with religion. they would not be killing other muslims if it was.
paris terrorist was radicalized by bush‚Äôs iraq war , abu ghraib torture

bad comes in all colors but right here ? crackers taking the lead low
i am done. with this b.s.
nonsense. name a single terrorist without a legitimate and stated political grievance.
your race has existed because of it is abhorrent treatment of people of color

what are you talking about ? please explain and be a little relax if you can !
i understand your anger the strong wrestle anger to the ground. & amp ; emerge stronger !
what due crackers mean ? i do not understand african/american slang ?
nothing humanly normal about being racist, result of systemic dehumanization !
racism comes from also destroying giza and the pyramids because blacks built it
do not know what u mean, so asking was done u mean ?
racism has even permitted religion saudi arabia is africa
u r wrong giant & amp ; pyramids are still there, islam is anti racism
not all white nor all black ppm, nor all ppm r savage,
where the nights inventing bigger guns ?
i used to be an apologist for islam. not anymore. islam is evil.
what about targeting property rather than people ? line blurred ?
helping the to fight is legitimate cause. not butchering into. people with other beliefs like
where are these imaginary people who are not white starting all the chaos ?
i am cool bred but yo not everyone is so understanding hence collateral damage
where are you talking about ? what is legitimate in your opinion ?
this picture of crackers is self explanatory
whites always like it was not me ‚Äú
i am non white survivor of apartheid, i am muslim, i understand your anger.
but that is because you are the one who will be tuned in the cross hairs
if those silly wars did not happen they would have found something else to blame. lame excuse
' and as an excellent patsy. they really know who to frame.
those persons committing these crimes where born and raised in france, where they learned.
no one is all bad but goddamn white people complicit to white supremacy like a much
conquest have prevented from acknowledging it is african home and roots
genocidal invasions occupations of terror r war crimes !
this is why the world fucked up because you do not know what the fuck i mean low
i thought you were being a normal racist
if your faith is not strong enough to cope with satirical poke , it ought not be strong enough to
and there you go with the link to a particular religion. like clockwork !
and definitely not strong enough to make you believe in it.
do you feel the same way about the things we have done over there ?
of course he knows. his faith is that strong !
what is it that is strong enough to induce us/uk/israeli troops to slaughter thousands ? scepticism ?
that unless a tenet of that faith is to kill those who poke fun at it
you seem to know who did it
questions will surely be asked as to why there was no armed guards outside the offices
cartoonist promises to draw mohamed every day for the rest of the year
such very wow.
having a laugh at any faith is not racism you idiot !!! insensitive maybe racist not !

but freedom of speech dost mean to abuse sum1 religion, cast, color or the family

. no deliberately provocative cartoons = no deaths ... simple ! psychos !
boy you sir completely echo my sentiments. * doffs cap *
' cartoons provoke hatred!!'pathetic!! again my opinion.

. the cartoons were drawn to deliberately provoke racism ..... and you, , support that ?
better kill yourself because our type freedom is not fucking going anywhere.
i would like to see viz draw him. put him in their next fat slags ' story.
then you do not know what fucking freedom is.
more innocent people being killed. what is your excuse for them today then !!
by them i mean the murdering scumbags who use religion as an excuse to get their own way
violence will never quash free speech in the west. these animals have to realism this
exactly. already blocked them for their cowardice and stupidity. terrorist sympathizer
good one go on !
finally. someone not afraid to stand up for free speech
innocent men were murdered in the name of satire. freedom of speech should never ever be punished.
i support free speech along with most normal people.
. does know that you support deliberately provoking violent reactions ?
awesome : next issue of will have 1 million copy run , up from 30,000 circulation .
that would be a good reason put france into flames of hatred.
that is the way to beat unpopular ideologies !
shameful killers will never win they are a few, we are many,

too bad they can not protect themselves with a gun. see what happens liberals ? üíî
complete lack of condemnation of mass murder from certain parts of humanity rings loud in my ears
bet those citizens wish they had american weapons
where is is official condemnation of the events ?
i very well understand the different approach to solutions. important to have universal brotherhood for peace
for mentioning the note dame de paris x caroline
killing will not stop in as much as there is people who do not have human feeling.
get to show the cartoons as a statement for free speech
every newspaper should publish a free issue of so we can all see the reason 12 people have died today
three nut job terrorists cost 12 people their lives - not an issue of a paper.
instigate things in name of freedom of press ...
i do not feel comfortable causing offense myself but i defend others ' right to do exactly that.
they but use the cover insulting catholics instead
says it will avenge attack by shutting down jihadi websites
the fact that queen has a magazine you can get is ridiculous. good luck to.
just like what they did to the kkk. i am totally for it.

nice if they could blow the shit out of the jihadists
wow. we are entered the age of cuber war.

unfortunately i do not know any 5 year old jokes üòù
the cop is name was ahmed megabit
and you should go talk to your ...... oh wait
not sure the is him one of the police killed was muslim
i always fit my jokes to fit the mentality of the viewer. bye.
got your rant out of your system now, or wanna write a few more replies üòòüòç
. unfortunately ... everything is wrong about this situation
. the world we live in today - it is all wrong
i love making the same jokes as 12 year old
has it been confirmed that he is muslim ?
i really do not like the idea of publicizing the poor man is dying moments everywhere, though.
i get angry when i am proven wrong too
just curious if anyone is confirmed it or if it is an assumption.
did you see there are cranks already claiming this is fake footage ?
developing : paris on high terrorist alert after shooting - hollande
have not they been always on high alert ?
more relevant than ever .
more hash tags more its hmm mm !
we already have enough suicide bombers
if it is you have not read it properly !
the sad part is they do that with a bomb around them in a crowd
they already do. they bomb themselves first.
they misinterpret it and blow the bomb in a crowd
true that. wish there were no religions to start with.
how indicative of a profound fragility of any faith is the impulse to murder anyone who mocks it .
any faith and which one -- again -- was this ? again !
is not a faith. it is a fascistic political ideology using claim of religion as trojan horse
good article on why we are not all charlie hebdo . ‚Ä¶ via and
i thought the article was aimed at folk like ap for self censorship, leaving ch exposed
business first then pleasure ... and until i win. it is all fucking business.
brilliant article. made me stop just hitting rt and made me reread.
perhaps we should aspire to be him instead
all i have to do is hit a target am close ... i can smell it ...
it certainly explains one is throbbing appendage fucking sadly.
going about your everyday letting amoral thugs change behavior is as courageous, mark.
indeed. just saw a fox news ‚Äò journalist ‚Äô claim the title. er, no.
well here is to your win being everyone is win
this is cuts through all the self pitying sanctimonious crap on twitter at the moment

none of the papers will have the bottle.
love that paper always beats rock.
sad bitch is that all you can say about all the people that have lost their lives !?
no before she starts talking white
in the meantime why do not you put one in your front window.
see sometimes u do say the right thing !!! üëç
will not be happening in the uk
any paper that does not republish motions deserves contempt and cannot be said to uphold journalistic values.
and no mainstream ran mohammad cartoons - violence already winning in uk
contempt is one thing barbaric murder is another - it mocked all religions and had freedom of expression
they are already censoring it. fucking shimmies
and ignore it ever happened ? fear of offending islam ?
now that is a suggestion that should be an absolute no-brainer. let is kill prejudice fatty x

is editor charb , assassinated today , said in 2012 : " i prefer to die standing than to live
a very courageous man. rip.
congrats on your tweet !
and he did. sad.
this is the one that brought me to tears.
no no no car - and now no life.
rt is editor chart, assassinated today, said in 2012 ...
you are the man.
charlie hebdo , the magazine that dared to poke fun at religion
really being satirical is part and parcel of liberty ~
closely identify with others find it absurd ! killing just compounds the stereotype
why are you singling out muslims when there are other groups to select from ?
this mag is satire ... and it was equal opportunity.
this is asking for trouble when you start making fun of other religions.
satire has been around forever - it is not for everyone is palette ~
is a fantastic religion is not it ? so glad it exists.
as an atheist i reject all religions ~ agree though ppm have the right to their beliefs
it is about respect and decorum, that is just my belief.
satirical is one thing but the disrespect of another is belief system is politically incorrect and taboo.
: satirical weekly will come out next week , despite bloodbath ( editorialist )
good good good ! vive
satirical weekly will come out next week, despite bloodbath (editorials) ‚Äù
no fear rt satirical weekly will come out next week, despite bloodbath
moderate muslims defend extremist but not victims . they merely say ( ' anyways ' condolence to family )
. false. i have seen many defend victims and condemn extremists.
yes very true same thing going on in trends in uk. some support religion or jihad sad
they develop a cold foot to speak against evils of islam and in favor of the victims.
last sentence of d twit is the truth.
hey wait though. that what they r doing right here
not just so called moderate muslims also white gentry leftists as well.
this is something that needs to change.
all 2 polish the cartons none found in indian media loud mouth ie silent. scard ?
we may not like it but it does not mean we kill.
yes this is about victims . it is also about how our communities reform & amp ; abolish blasphemy codes
i am not the problem. (politely) go and focus on the problem !
then examine yourself and understand you have got to change. you talk about gun laws after school shootings
but the fact is that cohesion increases recruitment.
tiny moments sometimes change as madrid is ‚Äú radical ‚Äú relates
yes but it has to be done so bring it on ! bon chance !!
thank you for writing that sis
i will stand with you tamera and so will many others
i am on my feet and staying there
talk to people. sometimes that is all it requires
doing it on train now. all it takes is being an active citizen.
enjoyed your piece enormously i have done the same today - challenge ignorance always every chance
you are very clearly to logical people very much at the forefront of the solution
engaging is key
i understand but it still does not tackle those who detest us for just being us.
not but it indirectly reduces their recruiting ability
great and timely the only solution we have in our pockets
you know i did not mean that. i meant grass roots level.
discussion is def the solution.
discussion is not the solution ?
maybe you could talk it out with isis.
why it is charlie hebdo is right to draw muhammad
we r living in a different world today, away from the western-centred worldview ?
note is statement about relations ? ignites global race wars, a divide and rule strategy
it was written on the 2nd of january 2013
i can not believe how filthy is the : ‚Äù
i am sure it does. an entire article is not required to say that. cashing in.
why it is charlie held is right to draw muhammad got in quick
it is not asking why is it ? ‚Äú it is saying it is their right
yes and we should all re tweet his cartoons
and other creationism should be insulted, religion is patriarchal bullshit
read the it says just that ...
probably their main target was islam.
the " extremist " muslims are actually obeying the qur'an . the " moderate " muslims merely stand by and
eliminating the enemies of is a collective duty, but can be executed by individuals.
the moderate ' is a transitory phase as we can see from is piece in papers today.
72 virgins is not in the duran, probably some crap the made up.
those that kill and are killed receive the greatest reward, i call it the 9-11 verse
the says that moderate ‚Äú muslims are the bad ones.
the our'an is very clear as to what a muslim must do in service for his/her ‚Äú faith
there is no such thing as moderate muslim
watch them do their dirty work ...
that is right that is what the duran says
moderates are the one holding you down with their lies while extremists cut your throat
here is all the evidence you need :
and the only reward alley has is 72 virgins after death. what a stupid belief system !!
shows no sympathy for instead start blamethemuslimgame trend. muslim mentality
cop has died sews charlie
one of the more stupid and uneducated tweets i have seen.
how cartoonists around the world responded to the charlie hebdo attack
so accordingly how could u justify the holocaust, salem trials and american invasion on islamic countries
you are a fucking idiot. none of those were the consequence of insults. grow a brain.
there is a big difference be tween humor and insult true, but neither should lead to violence.
. without humor we‚Äôre not humans.
we should no more blame islam for radical muslims than we should blame christianity for hitler. .
editorial boards ' inadequate they should publish & amp ; mohammad cartoons to mock the fucking
true but the criticism must be on the basis of argument not on just one event
the west used the and isis is not muslims as they are targeting muslims as well
there is a big difference be tween humor and insult
you should know they were from isis and you must know who funded them, not muslims
you do not get to kill people because you are insulted.
you would have been better referencing the crusades, or the spanish invasion of south america.
without we are all republicans.
that is awesome. they must feel targeted. at this point
- a brilliant image by . let is all stick our pencils up in defiance .
do not just be come take a stand -
up the are of the nearest muslim.
exactly no one will curtail our liberty of expression.
with a thick piece of lead on the end.

it is this hypocrisy and double standard
they had many drawings of hook nosed jews though !
the killers were non cause that was not islam üíî
it just happened to be islamist. could also have been any extreme right wing political group.
so you only object when lampoons christianity, buddhism, hinduism or judaism ?
it clinches an idiot. the comparison is pathetic
but i have suspected you are for some time. this clinches it.
not true. that paper poked fun at jews too
you mean did not draw about jews or christians ?
they were murdered by fanatics. the religion is of little import.
what fucking bullshit. that newspaper had anti semitic cartoons too. did jews murder the journalists ? no
so it is not a double standard to defend speech (even abhorrent speech) from murderous lunatics.
fair enough. trouble i have getting a lot of the other sort of idiot today.

you are confusing freedom of the press with refusal to forward an unpleasant chain-letter.
you need to check the context of this particular drawing. it was not racist at all.

when an ideology resorts to murdering satirists , it is publically admitting how weak , insecure & amp ; ridiculous
no worries. there is too much casual islamophobia online and elsewhere
my point was the same as the original tweet. attacking innocents proves how weak your point is.
ignorance on my part then. too much hate spreading on my tl. sorry my bad.
and when they can get away with it shows how complicit the powers that be are
true. it can happen in the simplest way. like misreading a tweet.
the us bombed the house of the artist who made this and killed her and her husband in 1993
but still lethal. and that is more than too much.
right. my mistake. sorry n tanks.

muslims are not terrorists
respect. stay safe man.

problem your little terrorist is a muslim.
respect to words ... a man is a man nonetheless
and this response a lot more.
of course not he is a fanatic, maybe you need more intellect to understand this
agreed. religion is about being human
they are both just because one is not a terrorist does not make the other a non-muslim

hi how are you this late evening ? find want to chat ? cynthia ca steel 2
saying or " i stand with charlie " is not an endorsement of their cartoons , imo . it is
i and i think for most people saying ‚Äú i stand with charlie ‚Äú is about that
i would like people to show me examples when they say held was generalizing about muslims.
my point on huff we are standing up 4 what makes us human. expressing ourselves freely
that is nice for you but it is not the point.
i am no fan of all their cartoons but i think solidarity important in this case
killing is not it is a foolish act and makes people lose respect.
good to know other people are uncomfortable with this hash tag too !
it is a defiant affirmation of freedom of speech, (whether satirical or no)
right to satirist without harm is endorsement of all satire, since freedom exists without limitation
can you satirist the emotions of europeans regarding holocaust and hitler in the same way ?
sure. nobody can justify the killing.
it is nice that you think so
i am very uncomfortable with it, you are not alone.
i feel that it is fully possible to have solidarity for those killed and not endorse the cartoons.
you may be right but the hash tag still makes me uncomfortable.
all you want. hebdo did

ideology can be hijacked. fundamentalism often has nothing to do with religion but with authoritarianism.
no organized religion was or is entirely peaceful. remember the inquisition ?
varying degrees of interpretation of freedom, which is always relative to socioeconomic context, etc but
when we talk about terrorists this good/evil argument is the problem and avoids the fundamental questions
agreed laura. let is not fall into the typical western neo-liberal/right wing trap here.
of course it is. so powerful. (and in fact it was published in 2006
no death by but they make it clear gays are not welcome ...
tolerance will not educate or make change. quick naive judgments need more than just tolerance.
for you but the community to debate over.
sorry i should have clarified. just found it relevant enough for today is event.
there is an argument for pro-western liberal anti islam-bashing yes but its inverse also equally detectable
again the problem with your argument is that it is a blanket statement you can apply to any religion/ideology
thank god is the religion of peace, or they would have killed two dozen.
be careful your ignorance and superficial views are showing.
this is the dumbest thing i have ever seen
giving the terrorists exactly what they want. what an embarrassment to journalism !

is a wonder. the un pays lip service to her courage and cause.
you know the majority of the muslim population regularly condemn these brutal actions ?
no one hijacked islam. islam made it possible to justify horrible acts in its name ...
that made me laugh.
this quick read is gateway into right perspective towards issue i will leave it at that
i think it was made in 2012, daniel. but what a picture.

what would the world say if, for instance, all attacks were done by russians ? russofobia ?
of are so please stu ...
may bless his soul.
i meant all attacks done by ' islamist '
its hard to hear the truth ...
r suffered more than any nation. read ply about it v. 6-11
eh what the fuck does russians got to do with it ?
most are still what they suffered from is islamist fascism.

there is only one thing happening in that picture and it is murder. despicable and cowardly killing.

2016 is going to be our best year. vote for donald trump.
that is the correct answer !
be careful what you wish for.
response to horrific murders should be to protect civil liberties not limit them . not an excuse for more mass
i don‚Äôt think legislation helps, if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre asking. i think it‚Äôs 100% wrong.
did not stop the though. what would help with that aspect ?
the tragedy is that allowing the next attack will bring inevitably the far right to power. inevitable ?
sad that people are using as an excuse to push more surveillance. that is not the answer.
you think increased surveillance is the sensible consequence ? (i expect i misunderstand your objection. )
stand in solidarity with fight for free speech.

we have no confirmation it is ...
for sure they gained experience in syria or iraq, they executed wounded man with cold blood.
great post why not post on proximity based travel network ?
sure it is could it be some other jihads group perhaps ?
how should they be punished ? death is just not enough ....

that is a great tweet. well thought out, well expressed and very worth thinking about
say in not so sally
would not it depends on what motivated the violence ? is not it all a mental illness ?
terrorism targets people. sabotage targets assets. propaganda targets lemmings.
i am pretty sure there is a crazy fuckers union for all of them !
he is muslim and he is not a terrorist
i am about to cry this is so sad
all true are no terrorists ! terrorists are those who interpret the koran false !
he is and he is not a terrorist ‚Äù this broke my heart
why should involve zany he was innocent. pity zany üò¢
he is really üò±‚ô•Ô∏è
is not a terrorist neither are muslims leave them alone
i am but i am not terrorist !
these are the most hurtful words anyone can receive.
been watching uk news all morning , seen no mention of multiple attacks on mosques in france after yesterday
he said multiple attacks on mosques. these are criminal acts beyond just islamaphobia. absurd to argue otherwise
the is a response to islamism like yesterday is massacre. cartoons do not deserve death.
maybe the media considers that to be a rational reaction to the events so not worth reporting
really hard to find it on news website too
was not that sent just now ?
err attacks would not happen if far-right thugs did not decide to punish muslims collectively.
flicked over to rt and they are the only news channel discussing it. disgusting really.
if a ' ' kills ppm, churches are not attacked. does not make sense
no news of that here in australia either.
looking at the stream they are talking about it right now, if that helps ?
i really do not think its anything to do with that. humans naturally suspicious of foreigners ... everywhere
12 people are and your concerned with ' islamaphobia '. blame the terrorists not the french.
shocking but not unexpected ! does not fit the narrative !
yes. saw it just after your tweet.
snipers , helicopters turn french town dammartin-en-goele into warzone . photo : dominique faget
surely some of your war correspondents would disagree.
en list vs publications. c'est damage/ i do not understand these pictures. you help the two brothers
the response to should be to reprint his work and spread it wider than his killers could have thought possible
i bet too many media outlets are afraid for themselves to do this.
which makes those that do so disgusting and lacking in actual faith.
you are comparing rape and murder to drawing a picture. really ? disgraceful.
a ridiculous example and in very poor taste. ‚Äú teasing ‚Äú does not warrant murder. agree ?
like i responds without knowing the facts. lots of knee jerking methinks
. evidently needs to do some research, is a magazine, not a person
just tell this imbecile that jews been characterized by others all the time but they do not slaughter
which is their problem to resolve, not the critics. time people grew a backbone.
or all sons of abraham,
grow up you backward its 2015 not 1015. you tell em louise
the people who did this were not true muslims.
lets just end this in this way respect my religion i will respect us and i again condemn this
u rape someone and then ask them nt to slap u
held was very critical of jews and israel
fair play to for her support for monsieur held.
and give all satirists licenses.
what is my religion exactly ? i do not ask you to respect any of my crazy unfounded beliefs
i am a son of brenda and phil.
anyways it was a nice debate ! at the end ‚Äú respect my religion i will respect us ‚Äú
so can not you take a little of humor with your bile ?
problem is there are morons who do just that to justify running about with ak47s.
we did not kill for free speech he is prophet mohamed ‚Äú is the prophet mohammad ?
yes they were. no true scotsman fallacy.
that is why i said read duran.
we did not kill for free speech he is prophet mohamed
you would struggle to bash my religion.
fuck you i have reprinted. what are you going to do ?
reprint and we will re kill until you respect our prophet ‚Äù
neither would i kill u if bash my religion
even web whose symbol uses condemned this. he is just
i respect all religions. i also can see satire for what it is.
if only they would read the duran instead of killing people in its name.
depends which bit they read.
and i would not kill you if you did.
then it will become the wildest dream to bring peace in the world
i know believe me i do not equate him and muslims or islam
nor should we really need to think about a redefinition of our notion of offense,
then what about the killing of more than 5000 innocent people killed in american drone attacks
start by re tweeting this louise, or are you really a muslim apologist ?
blasphemy laws imply that an all-powerful god is incapable of defending itself. this clearly makes blasphemy laws blasphemous
never. they need to grow up.
nothing says worship me ‚Äú like the threat of death.
every paper in front page.
. people mocking your belief is not a problem unless you choose to make it one.
that is what and has attracted a very strange set of respondents.
what is belief i mean r u an atheist, christian or what ????
have i fathered button or something ?
what does that have to do with some french journalists ?
be she is a good sort i think, just misled.
every newspaper etc should have their work on the front page tomorrow !
not knowing the facts does not bother ms mensch
reprint and we will re kill until you respect our prophet, like you respect the zionism or jews
which only serves to show their insecurities over their own faith.
12 shocking covers from muhammad to michael jackson
why what makes (or any other prophet) so special ? my point exactly :
it would not be as offensive as publishing a caricature of the prophet muhammad.
the problem is with the people that take offense. they are clearly mentally unstable.
and the bigger man is not provoked
nobody forces to read charlie held, why should freedom of speech be limited on their account ?
and how would that be satire ? again, satire & lt ; & gt ; hate speech/provocation.
but we are not do not you get that ?
because they are and serve only to inflame tensions. have some respect.
think i missed the joke on the lawsuit bit, but otherwise i completely agree with you there.
except unlike men with automatic weapons, is not an act of non-peace.
the cartoons are designed to be as provocative as possible, as you are well aware.
not really. but what i am saying is the killings do not retrospectively justify the provocations.
absolutely wrong. it is codified in islam that depictions of god or the prophet are forbidden.
12 shocking covers from muhammad to michael jackson ‚Äù click bait !
the offended have the problem. they could choose not to be.
people really need to get a grip. all religion deserves to ridicule.
satirizing violent religious beliefs is not ‚Äú shocking ‚Äú. the beliefs themselves are shocking.
not sure about banning but just because something is legal does not make it moral.
i never said he was. but i am glad you can recognize their similarities.
regardless of i think it is wrong to republish offensive caricatures of the prophet muhammad.
so shove this where the sun does not shine ...
evolution is ' way over the line of acceptability ' for creationists, should we stop teaching it ?
got shock it ai not here.
imagine nothing to kill or die for and no religion too imagine all the people living life in peace ..

no it was not. they have been publishing christian cartoons for years and years.
stop creating things that could elevate others anger - the result of what happened yesterday

dead but was triggered by the publication
exposing human folly to ridicule

cowardly to shoot unarmed civilians. too bad for them americans fight back.
that is why should be kicked out of europe.

savagely murdering innocent people brings only shame, not honor. monsters. ‚Äù
time to bring back day :
if i condemn the attack , that does not mean i support charlie hebdo , and if i condemn charlie
the risk is decided by the audience. if they stop paying then you stop working.
well obviously not considering you are siding with the terrorists and not those expressing free speech.
standing up for inoffensive speech is pointless. having free speech means standing up for all speech
by having never harmed anyone in my life you unbelievable fool.
then consider it as ..... a job hazard ? üòÜ
what love of bacon and gay rights ?
no they do not. they are publishing political cartoons and you are too dim to see their messages
and until you realize that, you will never be accepted in the west.
apparently you prefer offensive speech over moral decency. thus the instigation did.
just letting you know why it is that publishing offensive cartoons is ok in paris and not in riyadh
are you fucking serious making fun of ideologies is the cornerstone of free speech.
yes. that is exactly what i am fighting for. that is what free speech is
one party was a group of cartoonists expressing their right to free speech you insufferable cunt
you need to educate yourself before hastily arguing like this. silly claim.
my i condemn all form of extremism be it east or the west.
you lost the argument the moment you threw that generalization in. pity
ethics fascism dictates that. there is no ideology that is above satirizing or offending.
expected nothing more from an atheist like yourself. atta boy. üòè
are you targeting the gay community now ?
i do not care if the guy who is defending the terrorists thinks i am irrational sorry
thank you for diminishing any influence your tweets may have had with utter hate and ignorance.
freedom of speech is right to offend since non-offensive speech needs no protection ! islam is responsible 100%
at least in the west that is how it works, i do not know about pakistan
abuse discriminate they were cartoons satirizing an ideology, not a personal attack
the cartoonists were not being extremist by publishing cartoons. they were doing their jobs.
no matter how misaligned they are. thus extremism is rooting on both sides by some individuals only.
all of those things are absolutely true
the other was a group of rampaging savages letting their sand god dictate their actions
i would actually like to see it and even pay you if your drawing is any good üòÜ .
my sympathies at your idiocy and irrationality.
oh lord i am condemning both parties for the fiasco. both parties believe staunchly in their ideologies
you believe the cartoonists were at fault for publishing cartoons, not the terrorists for being murderers.
offending their religion is pathetic. just do not do it in the first place.
in your own the cartoons were an attempt to abuse and discriminate.
they did you the jews and christians did not try to murder them
you lost the argument the moment you cared more about people is feelings than expressing free speech.
cartoonists publishing cartoons is not poking you. they are allowed to take offense and lampoon your beliefs.
and you are saying we should capitulate to that violence ? that we should not print anything offensive ?
show me this cartoon you think is discriminatory ? there was none
then why go after judaism, christianity, buddhism etc ?
some things deserve to be offended and mocked and ridiculed, like your faith in my opinion.
sad as the incident terrorism goes both ways and should realize that.
6 days after charlie hebdo is 2011 firebombing , it ran an image of a cartoonist kissing a jihadi ,
sorry not correct but 1000 % correct. thanks for it

actually his constituency is tiny ... only the media lend him any platform for his moronic viewpoints
cause unfortunately he seems to have the ear of many !
we do not believe in sharia or halal slaughter !
only true would be peaceful and he is definitely not peaceful.
why give that waste of space any credence ?

even before hebdo killings , in many places journalism had become a life-threatening proposition .
good article. as a writer i thought of this myself.
yes i know. but his information was relied upon by journos. is exposing wrongdoing wrong ?
so satire is journalism i knew you guys made stuff up.
can not honestly connect killed at for what they wrote to journos dying for what they report
because journalists should say the truth without taking positions or shut up forever
places like for example
depends on your definition of ‚Äú journalist. ‚Äú snowden never claimed to be one.

any murder is but there is epidemic of male violence (incl suicide)
it is not. plainly.
it is not the first terrorist attack in france since the war.
is victims were innocent indeed. rip
it is very complicated how above mentioned racist misogyny is protected by white freedom of speech
really more atheist people died then peaceful muslim people in last 10 years ?
thats so what. that does not disprove anything. you are a racist by definition. annoyingly.
quite. the war ended 70 years ago.
also enslaved each other. and sold slaves to whites. do not be naive.

no it is a nightmare. they were innocent. rip
so you think this killing was justified ?!?
so then how are white people privileged
s it is to shoot dead 12 people for drawing a cartoon is it ?
if white people are privileged then you are admitting they were better than everyone else.
you know the then ?
white people are rich and educated (good) but deny their privilege of white supremacy
was an internal racist too, had to change race to white, it is global
may innocents rest in peace.
is a barbaric political death cult and should be banned from planet earth.
agreed much love to you today. much love to us all.
privilege has little to do with the freedom to make fun of a religion.
mock me my love ones but not my prophet (peace be upon him) never ever.
do not be mocking ' is not a terrorist action
the attack is but this is misogyny + racism
indeed. unless you are saying that the victims of today is attack were not innocent ?
a practicing criminal lawyer to b honest
today is victims were innocent indeed. rip
off course they were innocents. killing an innocent is like killing humanity.
whites and profited from slavery
here is come calling it worst in 40 years, compare to assad
i think you really need to mug up a bit on your post-war french history.
you are details are not in yet on the attack. thanks !

she really is not you know, but she is more than capable of telling you that herself
oh really how do you know that ? try some psychology. perception milan.
laws against killing make sense. religion is not required.
is not it a direct injunction by the said god to kill infidels and apostates ?
well to the point !!
obligated then some cans think that we can use this logic ? what happened in 9/11 ??
who do u have to apologize to and why would your apology be needed
not only that but like ... ash never mind
well keep it up dear every one free to believe, you believe nothing we believe something
tell me your argument what your belief ?
i would feel the need to defend my belief from what was tainting it.
the western people always demand muslims to apologize for something we did not commit
exactly. what are apologies for after the deed has been done !
that only makes sense to people that have sense.
so you are suggesting we should listen to terrorist threats lest they terrorize us. goodbye freedom.
it is madness. those guys were warned too and still did it.
it does not mean any induveduel decide himself and start killing,
do you think or you just doubt on others thinking
these attacks against civilians also incur a wrath of vengeance unfortunately against muslims, most being innocents.
what bothers me is the puppet holder. who did danƒ±≈ütay attack in turkey ? think that too.

well you are certainly not among those making even half intelligent its
but i agree that throwing the term ' racist ' about is just as damaging at times.
there is a problem with islam within many of our communities is not racist
and yet i know so many muslims who fit in just fine.
it is doctrines ref women and animal welfare prove it 2/2
that feels like a pretty hollow and speculative statement to me. at best.
spot on. needs to be modernized
today its past 3pm
absolutely right. but the word racist is thrown about freely nowadays. recognising
do not be silly. the definition of racism has evolved as a necessity.
people who attribute fringe behavior to any religion or ethnic group are racist.
within thankfully the majority do not take it as face value
is incompatible with western society 1/2
incorrect use of ' racism ' stifles debate.
i remember this lily lizard being taken for a ride
no it is not. so simplistic and misguided.
political correctness has allowed terrorists to thrive in our countries.
what causes them to be bad. submission to islam. hence dangerous
clearly quite the opposite. have a think. and remember
is a race is if i join i change my race ? what race apostates ?
freedom of speech is incredibly important. abusing it abhorrent.
there are others making sensible points. please get out of their way.
seen the amount of halal on our shelves ?
what utter rubbish are you spewing now ? only an idiot thinks that.
what are you afraid to confront everything that is evil and wrong.
and here in lies part of the problem. ideology is not a race
which has nothing to do with the adopted sentiment behind the hash tag. which was great.
the same applies to all religious doctrine. few take it literally.
nothing like provocation to end conflict, eh ?
but many people do. not a valid point
freedom of speech which our ancestors fought and died for.
it is the harsh truth. people fear of being called racist. look at rotterdam ...
you can be against terrorism without standing with racism.

not every fact is relevant for the news. journalism is about sorting and telling relevant facts.
continued ironic that we discuss america is faults particularly when the republicans were form
facts are what they are. never mind words games.
terrorists came to n. america n murdered/abused, enslaved/raped indigenous/ african ppm
continued formed to stop slavery that liberal democrats so desperately tried to cling to

the fact he was an islamist is very relevant. are extreme right wing fascists. the new nazis
the evidence is to the contrary
had he been a convert to buddhism we would not even know his name.
how many shooters were not reported as ‚Äú christian convert ‚Äú ?
. so we ignore reality to not offend ?
no more mister nice guy when this is the 2nd terrorist attack in 3 days by muslim extremists
terrorists who say they kill in name of allah b'cut of islam. wheres the problem w truth
the shooter was mentally ill. this is what racism/stereotypes created by bothering does-
but are there converts ‚Äú going on a shooting spree ?
someone who practices or christianity will not be violent. the teachings are against violence.
the shooter in monitor who killed 3 police officers was not called a christian extremist ?
we do not call all those who abused/killed the children in residential schools christian extremists.

it was declared a terrorist attack by canadian officials
shooting in downtown ottawa , police evacuating rideau centre and closing off wellington . stay safe students
exactly we tested the emergency alert system yesterday ! why have not we got a notification ?
avoid idea center and protection monitoring ~ a
why has not the university sent an emergency notification ? should have awhile ago.
canadian officials now calling today is parliament shooting a terrorist attack -
plausible. multiple locations. multiple gunmen. they have got to be motivated by something.
he is and has been a zero walking.
so was the etc .... not a mos sad setup ... new
glad to see somebody call terrorism what it is.
that seems to be the excuse to bring out the army, pretending to be police.
of course it terror permeated right out of mosques that are training centers to radicalize cans
down here it would be called work violence !
do you remember when was white. the great white north. before ?
that is like a robber or murderer getting shot and complaining about gun violence.
i call the execution of by a terrorist attack against the people !
are they sure it is not workplace violence ? maybe they should check with.
do not tell me ... the religion of peace again !
terrorist attack is canadian for ‚Äú workplace violence ‚Äú ?
racists ... we have your back. unfortunately our pres is muslim.
they obviously did not clear that w obama since he thinks he rules the world !
are you sure it was not a multiple sight work place violence type thing ... ugh
lets see if the lib media will pick this up. finally someone calls this what it is.
could it be that their coddling of the terrorists streaming into their nation ; somehow encouraged the wolves ?
ottawa shooting : - soldier shot at war memorial - parliament hill locked down - pm harper safe , '

i thought are supposed to be polite for once ....
snipers set up on national art gallery as we remain barricaded in centre block on parliament hill .
very rare. but it has been increasingly likely as we chop away at meet hath services
violence does not automatically indicate a relationship to me.
364 days a the cops are 100% unbelievable. today, everyone lines up to suck them
how the guy got that far leads me to suspect this is not what it seems.
the truth will never come out. martial law is coming
. what a silly response. they are targets 2 an embedded sniper. needs a make-over.
i am only saying that all three scenarios are plausible.
because does not fuck around with security
if it every guy in the nhl would be institutionalized.
that is why there are professionals. average citizen can only currently make a guess.
i have had concerns about that for a while
showing the shooter where those police are ???
why would you tweet the location of snipers ? who does that help ?
from the same cops and government who tell us that cancer-curing marijuana is evil.
in historical terms this is a blip. screw those losers.
call me bad i hope those fucktards get their asses kicked.
might be a good idea to not tweet about police movement/location ?
the science is it can not cure, i got a link hang on ...
this one was pretty good. stay strong ! odd day, but have a good one anyway.
and i know they will too
very helpful why would you tweet that !!??
email me at when you get a chance - good to know you are safe nathan
maybe just window
not everything will come out. but we will get details, especially these days.
sure but in how many years has this happened ? this is extremely unusual.
you expect social media to shut down during a shooting ? thats when most tweets happen fuckboi
holy i would never have known that was possible

these are not timid colours ; soldiers back guarding tomb of unknown soldier after today is shooting
no apology. not the same photo at all. good try.
who wants to have a ‚Äú go ‚Äú ???
not a hoax. this is before the shooting
really why would somebody post this without saying that ? twisted.
this photo was taken this morning, before the shooting.
that may be harsh. he seems to be honoring. just unaware of source.
no it was not the 19th. it was today. look harder.
the soldier on the right is the one who taken by visitor moments before shooting
i do not believe there are soldiers guarding this area right now. 2/2
it is not a but it also was not taken * after * the shooting.
do not steal other people is pictures without attribution. pretty simple.
because people like love stealing other people is pics to get its.
that‚Äôs the photo tweeted this morning claiming to be of the soldier who was killed.
this appears to be the shot taken before today is shooting.
apparently a hoax. best to take tweet down.
that photo was taken before the attack.

the gunman in ottawa has been shot and killed . i am at a loss for words this morning .
news is reporting the gunman has been shot. are you bitching at them also ?
they confirm facts before reporting '.
maybe people should not look to the tweets of comedy writers for their news facts ?
the gunman is still on the loose.
why should not a private citizen make a comment on a news event ?
seeing as though i was 100% correct, yes.
please wait on this. also sounds like multiple suspects. people need to stay vigilant.
the news report i am watching currently reported the same thing before kelly tweeted it.
i had heard the same before i saw you & amp ; many others tweet.
i had confirmed the first gunman was dead when i tweeted.
it is harper is though
i try unfortunately i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd protect me against bullets
what is your source that is not confirmed !
might want to actually confirm shit like that before tweeting.
where is the i give up ‚Äú emoticon ? do you not understand twitter ?

yes from her newly decorated la living room. just like egypt.

you are too ignorant to understand that extremism has always been there. blame harper
you force that woman in your pic to dress that way ?
your govt has changed to a military nation ...
that is cause only focused on humanitarian aid and not military
these extremist infidels are the problem not our govt

i believe pushed it too far
no ones even confirmed this was an islamic attack yet.
ottawa police correct their info . no shooting at the rideau shopping centre . everything now points to one gunman
everything now points is an interesting phrase under extant circumstances
who was down in parliament then ?
two people left the car. still looking for one
but several witnesses saw two men emerge from parked car without plates
wanting to keep ' vigilance ' w/o saying some crazed terrorist got away, maybe on a motorbike.

ya it all depends on which part of the koran they choose to follow. beginning is peaceful but
just as guilty as terrorism from extremists. what is your point ?
but they are sick fools and you do not usually see people of other religions killing
because they are racist ignorant pieces of shit that believe anything that is told to them
that terrorists flew two commercial airlines into our towers and killed 6,000 people. also hijacked a 3rd
could not just be a crazy who happens to claim to be muslim
person who committed the crime of 9/11 nobody would be calling all white people terrorists
please stop i still love my head üòùso peace out !!
because is not a religion. it is jim jones on a global scale !
reality of it. to clarify i am talking bout the extreme ones. not all muslims.
me and never said that islamist are the only ones who commit violence. we are just stating
so anyone who shoot and kills or bombs is a muslim this is too low even for
that is just wrong u should be damned ashamed
i still named more than u so shah !!
you are all blinded the media 9/11 was an inside job ask your govt
this is only a surprise if you are a democrat or a fool
start thinking for yourselves do not let the media do it for u
no amount of discussions will change the fact that these extremists are killing in the name of allah
because their religion usually does not tell them to murder people who do not believe
what about student who walks into a school with an automatic rifle and starts shooting at his mates ?
is made up of radicalized muslims that will kill anyone in their way. including other muslims.
luckily there is good ppm who still stand together in unity and do not let fear and hate infect
people shoot each other everyday why bring religion into it do they even know the motive behind it ???
do not represent maybe the united states govt ask
big corporations and the rich are riding high on the wave of fear created by the media
no kidding. all you have to do is think violence .... yep, muslim.
terrorists. you just assume that. isis is killing muslims in the middle east that support peace.
a religion of peace amp ; love ... üëé
they have an agenda against islam always have ... why are they he only one is reporting it ?
they usually leave that part out
wish you did not have to rely on wikipedia to talk about christian terrorism unlike islamic terrorism üòú
mentally mentally ill ... those who needed help but were not helped or never sought help
maybe but becoming a pretty sure bet.
oxford debate on islam :
you think is the threat think twice
you obviously missed where i said only the radicalized ones are jihadists. i never called all muslims
was it hard to guess ?
yes because that is what they keep telling you wake up
now there is a shock. how many reps we sending to his funeral ?
what do you know about 9/11 ??? really
you win i think that is what you want
the do i get a prize ?
claims they represent true islam hahn technically they hold true to the real islamic belief
i think he knows since he said it low
making us fear our neighbors serves their purpose to take our eyes off the gop

i was one of the guys he completely disrespected. he is a horrible human being.
what kind of pathetic post uses a tragic event to bash a consumer revolt.
i agree. there are a lot of aspects we need to look in to as a movement.
heres a virtual handshake and pat on back for you
its all good. everyone has been super great in their support. is freaking amazing.
you know what is worse ? i am not even that surprised.
just the fact people are trying to use such recent tragedy to push their views out is fucking gross
i heard that rumor too. what piece of shit tried to drag go into the ottawa shooting ?
and i just figured some ass would try that but hoped they would not.
these people are truly disconnected with humanity, if not reality.
it is because the trolls make you guys easy targets for the media.
no problem mans. we all gotta stick together in times like this eh ?
i also suggest forming your own game review site where you display ethical journalism to lead by example.
as a fellow thanks
this is what i am trying to figure out
but thanks for staying regardless of backlash. people still emotionally high strung atm.
yea but the media does not care about what you do positive just what the trolls do negative.
really not surprised they did it either. im appalled that they would tho.
look at these disgusting human beings.
men changed to people. typical saw sign. that sucks. sorry you went through that

rt this morning‚Äôs shooting incidents occurred at the national war memorial and on parliament hill. not idea center
did the soldier ... guard) have a loaded rifle ?
this seemed like a clear terrorist attack
shots at 3rd location yes or no ?
thought from will the people of ottawa shocking total shocking and well done to your emergency response teams
he was an honor guard so i am not sure if he did or not.
how did idea center get mixed in ? maybe it is on lock down only ?
any confirmation of the identity of these gunmen ? involvement of al-queda or isis ?
incidents occurred at national war memorial , near the rideau centre and parliament hill this morning .
but it is perfectly fine to shoot unarmed citizens.
stay safe men and women at parliament hill today
... can i help you ?
anxious to know the reason for their attack.
thats a really condensed area !
ottawa police issued a statement . three separate shooting incidents . once inside parliament . one at the war memorial
showed footage of shooting inside parliament : i found it quite disturbing üòû
canada is parliament hill is on lockdown as police hunt shooting suspect ; at least 1 injured - ,
praying for all affected by this shooting
so is strict gun control policies have failed
this is probably gun control has not failed at all.
that is such a uneducated comment
i am guessing will probably apologize to the terrorists on canada is behalf.
what you have only been there a week ! how did you manage this ! stay safe.

we in just got a small taste of the terrorist scum that israel has endured for decades,

how about have some class and focus on the victim instead.
but i no new countries a dun us get fooled by da media love it at that
they are they did but the public also needs to know who this coward is and the coward group
i understand that but there is always too much focus on it.
so stop spreading it around then.

exactly is not the persons fault is the countries fault
what a hero gave his life serving this great nation. rip.
stop giving him a platform. it does not matter what he looks like.

canada will remain the true north , strong and free , after today . these events can not , and
maybe it is just wishful thinking on my part but i hope not.
i wish we could but everything becomes political in no time.
my thoughts with everyone in ottawa at this time.
what will the gun grabbers say now
this will unify all right minded canadians.
sad about . worse , shooter might b guy who calls himself muslim . pls world dont judge 1 .
where are protesting in the streets ? 120 muslims penned a letter. that is jv
please elaborate. what other religions kill today in name of their religion ?
due to friends on seeing all my coverage of civil war.
i do not blame people who do ! second army soldier dead and a half-dead one in three days
amen. u preaching to the choir
exactly why they should be openly and publicly denounced. they claim to be islamic and soil islam.
. they will if it is an about a cartoon that offends them
how about you : ‚Äú do you stand up against rapists ? ‚Äù
just stop we know who the enemy is !
the problem is that the world does not see anything from muslims except extremists
i do not see 1. 5 billion muslims denouncing the extremist crimes against humanity
currently it appears that not all muslims are terrorists but it does seem that all terrorists are muslim .....
they have a religious state. they massacred palestinian population in gaza. buddhists in burma.
you are i am just judging the millions of mental muslims.
if every radical was shunned and condemned by the community less would fantasize about joining
you do not need to tell canadians that.
not accused for the crimes of their faithful people
i agree with u fistful !!
and if i remember correctly it was libya that supplied the ira with weapons and explosives .....
is a not a religion, that defends itself against attacks.
those with literal interpretation of islam claim divine support for their atrocities !
i blame the 1. muslims for allowing their religion to be hijacked by extremists

thank you for that post. looking forward to the facts coming
it is parliament hill. half would be a vast improvement.
thanks for your clear amp ; sober second thought as always
excellent reminder. particularly important in social media era.
except the dread. the dread is real.
yes because some issues are beyond discussion as this article proves
i lived on and was heading to school at mill when dawson happened. scary stuff.
true but being first to report is more important than being accurate. just ask cnn.
wow can you folks keep in mind that lives are lost ? is not that what matters most ?
i can not tell if you are saying half of what you have covered is untrue or not.

wapo reports that black eyewitnesses who confirmed the ferguson cop is story are afraid for their safety : sickening .
brown family set they will not believe autopsy nor any eyewitness that opposes them
just like two white guys who said his hands was up in a live video hmm mm
the truth does not fit the lefts ' agenda !
justice as it was intended. black panther style.
ottawa canada identifies the gunman who is probably muslim but that will not be mentioned .
but we are bigoted if we screen muslims at airports.
they all look like that way, plus his inability to do his job as lotus
he did interview high or extremely high looking.
one interview recently indicated he was on drugs or very jet lagged.
and the occupant of the be muslim.
told blacks that it was all whites fault instead of saying truth-a group of democrats oppressed.
our tax dollars are going to muslim foot washing stations in bathrooms & amp ; praying rooms.

you seem to be an angry person. probably same for these shooters.
i think they are helping ? its misguided and scary.
no sane anyway.
agreed. would have preferred it not real.
i think anyone with a live feed can tweet the location but they are all moronic !
trying to squelch the real news coming from untainted sources in
always the time. always be vigilant, and never trust the police.
i just remember history before 2006, is all.

you may want to stop and take a deep breath before tweeting insults at parliamentarians and reporters in today ,
disagreement is not unpatriotic n a time like this ‚Ä¶ it is just tasteless/vulgar/petty ‚Ä¶ inhuman.
i presume you don‚Äôt need to be told. other random mean people seem to need reminding.
politics should not exist on a day like today.
but reporters and civilians should refrain from tweeting out police locations.
who is yelling at reporters ? cause i would like to smack them

except for the reporters tweeting police locations. idiots.
but remember sh is not a parliamentarian.

can we have permission to use your photo at the memorial before the shooting ?
so why the crime scene tape ? can anyone clarify ?
both regiments are more than two centuries old, and have many battle honors and vs.
did you take this of the soldiers at the memorial ?
you were right sadly, he is now confirmed dead.
i am sure various reserve regiments and other elements of the cf take turns guarding it.
black watch is somewhat better known, but both regiments have proud histories and strong esprit de corps.
can we have permission to use this please for the canadian press. please email
i am seeing multiple tweets reporting he has died, including one from jason kennedy.
any member of either regiment would be very quick to set anyone straight about the difference.
being made on page
yeah ... i am you on that. seems insensitive if the family is not notified.
yes. it must be the greatest honor. my heart aches for his family.
. i am guessing they are reservists since there are no highland regiments in the regular army.
can the press please have permission to use your photo - 416-507-2169
i can tell that i just need to learn about those histories.
too not it. /*sigh*/

today is tomorrow is terrorist
please stop your you are attacking a large group of people as innocent as you

mosques in the nations should be put on 24x7 surveillance. mosques create jihads.
another you should stop generalizing for god sake.
he took an oath to save lives now takes them

just lovely. more security theater.
the best way to fight terrorism is for the etc to be consistently on time.
wake up .... if terror comes here ... world is doomed
why i understand the event is tragic but it is in ottawa, not toronto.
the statement also notes that ‚Äú there is no credible threat to public transit in toronto. ‚Äú
better than your body blown in half
if the dudes who shot up ottawa are white , are we going to have a conversation about terrorism or
do not you know white people can never do anything wrong
important : ottawa police are urging people not to tweet the location of police activity in the field . shooting
not even close. responsible gun owners are everywhere here. i know because i am one.

workplace violence wow crazy. the whole thing is sad. unarmed solider doing a ceremonial guard
thank you for kind words.
very stay strong
think before you speak. so disrespectful.
this is an attack at our parliament building and an attack on our soldiers.
it was an indictment on the horrible gun situation in the u.s. it was not a joke.
this is more like the 2x a year when someone gets near the white house.
a soldier that fought with your country to protect you was murdered. show respect !
this is why i am proud to be canadian.
a soldier was killed this morning by that shooter.
you need to do a little more research on that comment
this is why i am proud to be canadian. ‚Äù proud to be due
you nailed it.
apologies for the dumb ass calling it wednesday. our pres calls it workplace violence
if it was the white house tho.
i do not mind potential terrorist attacks, so long as they stay that way.
and in we can spell. the b is silent.
potential terrorist attacks are definitely the norm here ‚Ä¶
i do get that. but it is a sad day in canada.
congrats on your tweet !
have not had a shooting in the halls of congress. this was an assault on democracy.
and our killed the shooter. second solider murdered in canada in 2 days
thanks for the neighborly love in this time of pain in canada. acts of terror are not funny
most got your back. stay safe.
that looks like it happened ... sad
i completely get making the point about gun violence in america the timing was just a little too soon
this one is gonna get you in trouble girlfriend ...
but the nastiness reaction is the dark side of twitter. looks like nra style campaign.
but can nationalists do not equate to radical islam.

let is be worried about all ppm on parliament hill right now. not just the pm !!

officer wilson will not face any criminal charges in the shooting . he was defending himself . be prepared people

coincidence ? nobelist malala youseafzai was to receive honorary canadian citizenship in ottawa today
my sarcasm font evidently does not show up well ...
i think they corrected that and said ceremony was in toronto
i stand corrected. rt i think that ceremony was planned for toronto
i think it is more than a coincidence.
she was receiving this in toronto today - not ottawa.
so terrible. peace and love to the world. may the brave stand brave.
might want to read the article you are tweeting. she is receiving honor in toronto.
any of it. no peace in islam morons.
i think that ceremony was planned for toronto
how dare you imply
i got the moron part was for the islamist.
but i hope to god this was not meant to be a multi-city event
i say no this barbarism was let in & amp ; now we reap the whirlwind
agreed. she has gotten threats even here in canada
she is actually visiting not ottawa. the pm was set to go there this morning.
i think it was set for toronto ... not sure.
do not forget this from last month
ceremony to honor to take place in toronto -- not ottawa.

have dawn sing the national anthem tonight !
this is a great idea.

i totally agree would be such a touching and amazing gesture
good i am glad it all ended relatively peacefully. and you are all safe and well.
welcomes living in myself seeing pens singing o canada just made me lose it emotionally
it would be a great gesture to those injured and me and my fellow
it is crazy here for sure, really hope they are caught asap and brought to justice
we are all save now ! thank you for your kind words.
key : nothing in wilson is story in new autopsy says he feared for his life or life of another
. you are clearly one of the reasons the dumb blond stereotype continues to be perpetuated.
even if that never a struggle for his gun validates the shooting completely. clown.
not when the perpetrator is 20 ft away a running ....... oh clown
no altercation between the two with another person at the scene did the autopsy show that ?
nothing in the autopsy say that michael brown feared for the life either.
great job on the miller show ! keep spitting that truth !
u not be in fear if a giant black dude was trying to kill u ?
it does not even say why brown was stopped
thanks. stands by for call.
you are not allowed to go on vacation !
you are too dumb for words.

always look in the parts of the wallet that do not get used often. sometimes coins in there
proud of you lee. these progressives need to be called out. today, more than ever
i am surprised is not speaking out about the virtues of the religion of peace

dear confused right-wing friends : my article was about monday is car incident , not the ottawa shooting this morning
and too soon ‚Äú
scandalous we let these cripples come here
by the definition of terrorism i read around, any premeditated assault anywhere could qualify as terrorism ‚Ä¶
. we and you are still fucking insane.
defends terrorism by insisting it is not terrorism, but attacking off-duty soldiers is definitely that
. it was probably those mackenzie brothers, angry about a mouse in their beer.
he thinks that is anything but a distinction w/o a difference ? lol.
. dear openly defends a terror attack on canadians in his article
practices genocide against many people, you do not care and feel action against them is an outrage
west is not under attack- david copperfield is just hiding the wt cs ! ‚Äú
why would not the same logic apply ?
excellent piece on radicalism cause and effect. it reminded me of this :
. not sure that is better.
is that jean arose i have got his hockey card at home !!!!
i have been more convinced by drunken japanese karaoke wails of ‚Äú i did it my way ! ‚Äú
answer the question. what is the difference ?
we will soon find out but we are all thinking the same thing ...
writers can be but not that fast.
no place for causation in manicheism.
but it is important to know. that is our job.
. got it ... you are a dyed in the wool right winger ... move along now
. if you have the patience ... try to research and see who started it all
. i do not believe i did.
no wars for the oils !
dear confused dumb ass. they are the same ...
not complicated rt analyzing the cause of violence is not defending such violence.
you are doing so much to discredit the great work done by you and snowmen ...
oh dear. mt my article was about mondays is car incident, not ottawa shooting this morning
that is not always true ; in fact, most of the time it is not true
the situation is still unfolding. it started only a few minutes ago.
how does the subject of the article change the fact that is a douche ?
i mean too soon ‚Äú for a bob and doug joke
. thank ma'am. . .
noted public shooting advocate greenland.
we do know they were a terrorist though
. that explains your childish ignorance ... we are done
yes. use big letters and crayons for little weedy
the beginning of the end : why the west can never beat isis
never the ideology. nope
yep. drinks coffee
so defending is now known as analysis. gotcha.
global state. 1991. brotherhood. in the us. they brought it here.
. analyzing the cause of violence is not defending such violence. but war mongers do not agree
if you are ever in need of a bridge, i can hook you up. bye now.
just like doctors are ‚Äú defending ‚Äú cancer when they say it is caused by smoking
. . . he feels canada was wearing a short skirt in a bad part of town.
but that is just it. . is career depends on propagating a false, simplistic narrative.

' defending the west from terror '. yea you really nailed it.
right. more rubble less trouble ‚Äú is a profoundly important opinion.
fair point. my apologies.

is wrong with you ?????
um ... terrorism was invented by.
um .... not nickel back. it would be totally inhuman to blame israel for that.
here is an harper supposed 2 meet w/male and can troop left 4 kuwait to fight isis
you are blaming for terrorism in canada. how about blaming islam which encourages terrorism ?
i called that one. so annoyed by is very existence. he needs to die.
not blaming the at all. just making an observation.
just because commits terror acts every day does not lead me to conclude that judaism encourages it
good guess but that clock was in beverly hills.
is also to blame for famine, ebola, north korea, and nickel back ?
that is had terrorism before harper. do your fact checking moron in from canada
broad is probably going to rock contemporary with his museum - is it open yet ?
do not beat your maid missy !
either hotel be air or the peninsula. lol.
like seek and end to extremist violence that means joining the war.
you are such a fancy pants. is the pic from the getty collection ?
yes. must be the fault
it is really ironic that the green party is still around.
is what i mentioned not a fact ? canada did not have terrorism before harper / israel.
that it is. is amazing. just the architecture alone is beautiful.
you are so defensive i was joking around low
because going to war has ever solved anything.
blaming the that did not take long.

how does know this was perpetrated by no terrorists ' ? is this another false flag operation ?
quite so. yet poisonous comments show that there are still many morally backward people about.
agreed. they need six mega wow pieces and they are golden.
very true. i say impressionist and modern/post-modern art.
ironic given that is himself a terrorist and a war criminal.

if you have a minute can you give me a call ? 604. 331. 2766 thanks
if they have not found the gunman yet i hope they find him and shoot to kill.
proud of how handled this today, many heroes.
what a risky political stance to take.
can not it is the brave people ‚Äú ?
can we all call you as well ?
if your first response to the is to make a political point , your humanity is sadly and sorely lacking
like holder amp ; ram emanuel ? liberals never politicize !
political correctness paves the road for these types of shootings.
the attack is against the pm and the canadian government. you know nothing do you ?
the attack was on parliament hill ! what part of that is not political ?
let is sit and wait for your next few tweets. bet you contradict your humanity.
mine was tears. and only tears.
the incident in is sad and worrisome.
what is one meant to do ?
agreed. but your second or third response once evidence is known could/should be.
first response should be check ammo supply !
you gained the upper hand by tweeting like super liberal.
praying for everyone in ottawa right now
parliament hill and surrounding areas are under attack after 3 shootings
oh my i am from alberta so i did not know but prayers to everyone !
be careful what you read about ottawa , and what you repeat . tipsheet via

indeed. lots of misinformation floating around out there ...
stunning photos from ottawa
shooting war memorial parliament one dead rt
stunning photos from ottawa ‚Äù this is where the shooter was killed.
this is absolute madness. what is going on in my country i fought so hard for.
so sorry they now have ‚Äú workplace violence ‚Äú like us !!
i can see no gain of knowledge from these pictures. none.
israeli pm calls pm harper to extend condolences for shooting , express full support for canada is fight against terror
where they think is royal canadian mountain police ... (* cnn today)
did send another letter praising the mosque where the shooter attended ?
and that justified the bombing of a red cross hospital how ?
did the criminals discuss further genocide operations in middle east ?
i could say the same thing to you, sir
we r so unfortunate that us is our neighbor country
but did pm offer condolences to pm for 3-month old baby killed in terrorist attack ?
what about first stopping it towards palestine ?
terrorists used ambulances to go from one place to another.
oh did i hurt your jewish feelings with the truth, let me block you then
the if is investigating that incident. it was an unfortunate accident
so what that is not news cbc !
tried to minimize civilians casualties, have u head of ‚Äú knock on the roof ‚Äú ?
recognizes stops ambulances and tank buster missiles üòÉüòÉüòÉ
less than 1,000 kids and 1,000 cold blooded terrorists
this is what happened when u blindly support us
we do not need condolences from genocidal mass murders thank you
this tweet makes you sound ignorant
lets see how you will handle terrorists that are trying to kill you and use civilians as human shields
frustrated by canadians ' lack of panic .
it is called being rational and not living in fear like idiots
we have got for that in quebec at least
why am i not surprised by this tweet ?
obviously they are not watching enough cnn !
does not have fox news to get everyone all worked up
the pittsburgh penguins had oh canada sung tonight vs philly in honour of the event in ottawa .

but i did not provide positions, movements or photos of locations ... opec intact.
but you just tweeted the shooting @ parliament hill ?? üò≤
a reminder for those observing the shooting on parliament hill : do not tweet police locations and movements
just saw a member of the public go up to a cf member and shake his hand and thank him
god bless all our forces personnel !
wilson claimed he " radioed for assistance " discredited by dispatch transcripts :
now that he is proven he is a liar, when do we arrest him ?!!
city does dispatch for them. you can hear it on the dispatch tape.
nothing much has changed since jim crow in missouri.
he lied he never did nor did the store owner call in a robbery
i do not think he or his friendly leaders can keep his story straight at this point.
shout out to for info leading to this discrepancy.
shout out to for info leading to this discrepancy. ‚Äù
everything pd say is but would still like to know facts, details, etc
troll account created to harass ferguson activists. look at who it follows.
they would have been notified of officer involved shooting. instead they learned from media reports.
because people smoked and already wounded, always charge police !! makes total sense.
county dispatches for fed and at least one other pd.
so stock photo you are one of the conservative nut jobs/racist trolls.
holy i pooped my pants batman next thing u know he will be n da pen.
they were released by anonymous and can be heard on you tube.
thinking of layton is words : " love is better than anger . hope is better than fear . optimism
oh shut it. not today chick.
a beautiful sentiment for this challenging moment
and fantasy is better than reality. what drivel
not much solace for the mother and father of the soldier who was shot.
new evidence , including autopsy report , supports darren wilson is account of ferguson shooting
spoken like a true constipated cracker.
those who lied to the grand jury hopefully will stand trial on charges of perjury.
nope. it was who was witnessed making the initial aggressive acts with car.
grabbing is shirt does not sound so hard.
sounds even less plausible that mb attacked an armed officer with his fist. ludicrous.
lets not be ridiculous amp ; spin this.
the robbery video does not even show the cash register where may have paid.
new including autopsy report, supports darren wilson is account of ferguson shooting ‚Äù
but this case got cheapened by all the bs racist talk. the real message is getting lost
not a single piece of evidence even hints at racism. thats where this case became lost
you can not be serious.
maybe you can offer an explanation for why that is the case with traffic stops, arrests ...
why do so many people think unarmed guys attack armed cops ? makes no sense.
clearly you have not read wilson is statement from yesterday
you too my best to you and yours. may justice prevail
may not have intended to murder, but it looks like he could not control his anger.
was is gun on his right or left side ?? idiots
no silly. the store turned it over after the customer called them.
amp you think this protest has been executed well/ helped their cause ?
the concern expressed from residents protesting is the history of ferguson pd profiling
admitted they stole the cigars
yet he just robbed a store. did not exactly pick the best example for their cause regardless
to determine that he ' robbed a store ' you would need charges prosecution, and a conviction.
that is why the author of this report needs to claim pot made mb crazed and erratic.
i think we have pretty much covered everything. üòâ
you honestly think cops hunt down blacks to murder ? honestly ? what world do you live in ?
it does no such thing.
uh ... there is no proof that even knew about the alleged shoplifting incident.
of course it does rt new evidence supports darren wilson is account of ferguson shooting
good luck with that mindset. you would rather believe cops are just murdering people for no reason ?
peace to you. best wishes for us all.
not as awkward as a cop trying to grab a 6'4 300lb man through his car window
does the strong armed robbery make sense ?
my agenda is justice. what is yours ?
so you think the cops stole the footage then, i am guessing ?
i would like to agree with you but i think that is to be determined.
i do not see how was able to reach through the car window and punch in the face.
that is where your premise fails. there was no robbery id by wilson (per chief)
the message ' from residents is blacks are targeted by pd disproportionately
you do not have to defend that your opinion could change. that is rather obvious.
if justice facts should trump emotion.
this seems does not it also matches dorian johnson is account ??
a customer called the police. the store personnel did not even file a complaint.
outstanding . thanks so much for your commitment and support !
would not it is awkward far a tall guy like that to throw punches through the window ?
surely you have an opinion about whether the shooting was justified.
i can appreciate that investigation but the race angle ? cheap
an opinion sure. but that could change based on evidence/facts. sad to have to defend that
has not has the balls to speak out about the shooting m
only people giving mike brown the benefit of the doubt are people with a certain agenda.
i am going to disconnect from the convoy at this point. thanks for the discussion mm.
we will j accept anything damning to the victim, accept anything favorable to the shooter ?
stay safe ottawa . stay strong canada .
been scared about this happening for months. worst nightmare came true ! thanks for your concern.
my prayers go out to ottawa. just so scary xx
thank you so much for your thoughts and prayers. love from canada.

i still can not watch that without tearing up. surreal week here in boston.
no it has this he speaks of saturday is game clearly, not tonight is.
just tonight is game. not saturday is.
i think it is tonight game that is not saturday is
tonight is game is postponed no word on saturday is game
still gives me goosebumps just thinking about it and remembering it, never mind watching again.
that game has been postponed.
i will sing it loud and proud at the blues v caucus game tomorrow.
you are correct. thanks for clarifying. sorry for any confusion.
. i am with dominic !
i am getting visions of the game after the boston marathon. chills.
in his last three games , kobe is averaging 26 . 7 points on 42% shooting , 4 . 3
40th best player he proves u guys wrong .....
which could be similar to his regular season numbers
now just do that for 60+ games & amp ; you will prove espn wrong
his shooting percentage should go up to about 45%
those will go up when the season starts and the pressure is on.
and he only ranked 40th low
while i am happy he is producing, i would rather him produce less much efficiently.
how many wins is though ??
that looks. awesome low now if only he can get us a double digit lead with that !

what i read no. could be shot to death ...
in every traitors are hanged by the neck until dead. do not be an idiot.
is that why you want preemptively arrest all islamist ? do you believe they are all traitors ?
arrest before they murder more canadians. change the immigration policies that let them into the country !
let us not forget we believe in the rule of law. innocent until proven guilty.
very another victim of ? need to do more
. is this a different one from the shooting at the center block ?
hello i work at a london newspaper, the independent () - can we use this image please ?
hi could we use your pictures in the independent online please ?
authorities refuse to say whether parliament hill gunman a canadian citizen , or whether he was one of 90 people
as we all should.
what does it sometimes the biggest traitors come within.
is it impossible to be both ?
ha well there is your answer then
most or all of whom are ' canadian citizens ' ?
perhaps we should eliminate the known terrorists
hate to say it but we ‚Äú politically corrected ‚Äú ourselves into this.
i suspect phrasing is innocuous and inadvertent, but of course they are not necessarily mutually exclusive.
all ottawa police stations are closed to public due to shooting at war memorial . no public services available until

the suspect who was killed was dropped by a gun nut who trained constantly . you are welcome , pansies
they would like to say no, but that reveals their anti-liberty belief system
i am sure the professional involved will be delighted to be described as a ‚Äú gun nut ‚Äú
once again you‚Äôve shown yourself to be incapable of answering the question.
ah now we get into the childish name calling portion of the program
how did that work out in today‚Äôs situation ?
now that we‚Äôve dispensed with that dodge, can you please answer the question.
those who is an are anti-liberty will dodge and deflect such questions.
common sense is made up of two words.
yet the pansies will still vehemently go after gun owner is 2nd amendment rights.
common sense by definition what you are preaching is uncommon.
how do you really feel ?
you are having trouble answering a simple question
that is a great litmus test those who agree with the will simply ans yes.

like i said u had canadian senator george baker giving precise details of where/what on tv media.
it is all about info control. gov not nor media want citizens 2 have free flow of info

yeah we should only allow cnn, hsbc, fox and all other ‚Äú news ‚Äú outlets do that
i feel like this should go without saying. no ?
that is so true come on people grow a brain
but not disagreeing that common sense should be used. unfortunately not much of that anymore.

searches are everywhere downtown. there is no exact locations.

you are aware that not ‚Äú anyone ‚Äú can walk in and buy correct ?
yes. she has curious what extra restrictions you would propose for 2a ?
agreed. classic clueless lib response. refuses to assign responsibility to individual.
anyway good healthy debate. g'nice.
it is a good thing the sergeant at arms had a gun in an anti gun environment.
it is not likely because of background checks. it is polly stolen. i own 4.
banning guns will not do anything to solve crime. look at chicago, illinois.
personal responsibility is important. gun dealers & amp ; manufacturers are not exempt.
yes cause giving all thy power to someone else will not have them abuse it.
what changes would you make to current laws ?
exactly so why do lies have such a missy fit over guns !
and you do understand not only criminals use guns irresponsibly ... correct ???
guns do not kill people. . . . people kill people !
why would someone post something like this ?? why ??
and people have the right to call her out on it. also protected free speech
wine replenishes brain right ?
it depends on how it is legislated.
that is why they could not defend themselves.
that was complicated. i am surprised it is not perceived as anti-bieber.
and your point is to further restrict the ... good luck with all that. adios.
to add background limit bought at shows & amp ; n magazines.
it is our job to regulate who gets gun with commonsense gun legislation reform
also do we know the guns were acquired illegally in today is case ?
comparing it 2 an individual who feels like they are on a mission from god to kill nonbelievers

depends on how it is legislated etc. it is very effective in australia
almost willing to bet my life savings he bought the gun in america.
she has the right 2 compare a terrorist act 2 an everyday shooting
give me statistics a source !
reports indicate shooter had levered action rifle. slow to reload, so thankfully, not many
sop blowing this out of proportion. do something worthwhile. instead of having weak arguments on twitter.
i know stupidity blows my mind daily when reading comments ! like it hurst my brain
and for you get a follow
everything is legislated. it is not that hard to understand that many factors are involved.
you are we should just keep selling them at walmart to anyone.
that is because bad guys get illegal weapons. law abiding people are sittings ducks without a gun.

is a religion of 1. 5 billion people. stop associating terrorism with an entire religion.
timothy the government ? the kkk ? the bush administration ?
sorry but twitter is not better than that
every city in black children ...
but let is end the name calling.
the truth will not make anyone a hypocrite. right or wrong. mentality is a casualty here
much more than attacks ???
easy to say when you have not been affected.
in north ?? aurora, sandy hook, washington navy, monitor. since 2012
that is not a terrorist. lol
this is a flagrantly absurd statement.
you are obviously very small minded. and need to go get some education.
at least i am not pretending to be pc
i know many. how old are u low
from what i recall they were mostly middle class christians
cheers.
imposing will on civilians and taking away their rights that are even written in laws is not terrorism ?
well tell those masters to put your muzzle back on
no low i was speaking on the generalized hate of an entire group of people.
or have a law read to you, and then have your civil liberties violated by a cop
white children as well.
i have 2 masters. next.
not terrorists. nice try.
her remark was hypocritical. yeah the solitary mentality of an individual not a group.
i do not hate just extremists.
please take your and ignorant ass somewhere else.
it is easier to simply pin terrorism on one group of people, ignorant cunt.
a few rare exceptions will not change the stats.
you just hold prejudicial views on religious groups, you are smashing.
it is true. there are more islamist attacks of terror than the other examples you site
we can not know until the truth is out. ppl always make assumptions.
that is not terrorism. ugh.
the lesson here ... do not break the law
do you even know what the word hypocrite means ? think before you speak ignorance please.
much more than islamist attacks ??? ‚Äù we have had so many in canada ...
actually is a designated terrorist group.
intense new audio of , people scrambling , " where do we go ? "

big deal dog got him. oh & amp ; way to change the subject, einstein.
looks like they needed to have more ' active shooter ' drills ...
too much liberalism has ruined a country. time has come for the civilized world to realize this.

i smell a security drill.
the jihads are trying to terrorist the entire world while they themselves are insecure in their own lands
but the world does not need police low

the police are mostly positioned in and around parliament hill today
the thoughts and prayers of are with right now , and with the families of those affected by these attacks

sobered up enough to correct your first tweet ?
i know right i thought the same thing.
a soldier was killed today, and you are trolling the internet about toronto politics ?
of is most populous and future attack-prone city than i have today. 2/2
get the facts before you tweet, stupid
more important things than having a competent and pulled-together political leader ?
well said rob hope you are doing well.
there is a time and a place.
was that really necessary rob is a good man who made a mistake
u think the fire a few weeks back was related
i always say ottawa is the best place to be from and very safe . nothing changes that today .
safer than our capital that is for sure.
god bless all that protect and serve.
agreed video from inside parliament :
well said. i loved it when i lived there.
canadian forces bases across country being closed to public in wake of shooting of soldier at war memorial .
very rude to make assumptions about that.
what have we heard about the shooter(s) ? besides that one is dead ?
our thoughts are with you. god bless. stay safe and kick ass !!!
where is this information from ?
it is certainly looking like it. another attack
my condolences to all except the shooters. fuck them.
it is what i am seeing via twitter as well as what is being reported on cbc
hoping safety precautions are being taken in to around & amp ; wonder if ottawa events connected.

during or after his round of golf ?
why is not he is briefed on the shootings going on in chicago ?
very sad that someone died in ottawa . who has to die in a country to mobilize it for war
the majority are fed the line of security threats, and a strange takes over
should then continue to play the role of ‚Äú not getting ‚Äú involved while being involved.
watch vice news on the is ... it sickened me
personally in calling on this one. shit worked for bush why not harper.

i admire the way canadians are responding to the . keeping the focus on the victims rather than the perpetrators
preserving the dead rather than helping the survivors ?
probably one of the many differences between canadian and us-mentality. no offense
indeed. i am speechless.
that has not stopped from speculating on the shooters. their coverage is shameful !
none taken. that is precisely what stood out to me
you honor victims by punishing perpetrators. something that the weak never learn.
not to overwhelm with my canadian cynicism, but it could be because the perpetrators are unknown.
there is a lot to admire about canadians.
am very sad to hear of today is events.

hello gunpowder on his hand ? pathologist already stated the logic. nothing but wannabe thug
you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.
forensic findings found he attack officer.
so other black people who protesting will not beat or steal from them
no i followed your point i was asking the doubter to think
of course when comes to black people complaining and whining, science is not enough evidence
now if he had attacked some doritos, ok, but nobody wants to fight while high
ask why would they be afraid to say publicly what they saw ?
what is there to update ? foresinc studies proved attacked the police officer.

clearly what i would read was wrong
. just appeared on tv to explain the gunman is so not islamic ... i am relieved
these nut bags still allowed threatening to kill muslims and brown people.
would not approve of their action or the action of all those killing in the name of islam
your logic we can attack muslims as we want. drone them kill them and torture them 1/2
who kills in name of allah ! who uses human shields. no tolerance for radical islam.

why is this fucking bitch caring so much, still mad paris ... fuck off man

it is definitely a flag used by isis and every islamic terrorist in the world

send the gunman to fucked hell

the second is the flag right ?
that flag and the flag are the same. just different writing but share the same message.
they are following your prophet.

you have a great day also ! peace & amp ; love always !
original text copied how disgusting are these pole ? killing in the name of our beloved prophet saw

maybe the rape and sexual enslavement justified here :
you are gonna re write history ...... ignorant ? pot kettle
like that is in there ?
do not forget the bible though it was okay to stone babies
so now we have to worry about shiites as well.
not a just have a different opinion to you. all communists identify dissent as trolling.
and has he not declared himself a recent convert to sunnis anyway ? that is what i heard.
what proportion of do you think believe the bible is infallible today ? how many even know stuff
and there are many civilized muslims that respect women and children get over it dickhead
did the entice the koufax with dates and mistake ?
again please back your claims with actual proof not speculation
the also say that. they say similar but not the same.
uh cos i can read
and practiced by book harm etc.
so you are saying it is arabs that are the problem ?
and what book of had its, not all faith are authentic btw.
u can not expect them 2 even respect the religion when they killing their own people.
falls at the feet of men ?
i always wonder why certain things were ok for mo but frowned upon for isis ?
speak for a religion. you know the difference between faith and the eu'ran right ?
course they do. it is a religion of peace.
clearly not so innocuous as far as the perpetrators here are concerned.
that translation for one is not something i can explain i will be honest.
your quoting mass terrorists groups that have killed more muslims than anything ...
like mass execution and sexual slavery ?
yep ... exactly like that. destruction of property. . list goes on.
sorry is whatever ... brain is exploding
well why r u disgusting.
now then anyone else gutted that this is all happening in a chocolate shop ... üíî
4. 24. by the way ignorant is not spent with an ' e '
bullshit. stop being such a fucking cop out. jihad is jihad.
truth no normal backs him, just desperate people that have nothing.
why does the caption above photo say it symbolizes engagement in jihad.
a book promoted by a known, war lord & amp ; rapist. nice start to a religion
plenty of people in who do not even know how to write syntactical english.
no. it is nothing to do with muslims in general.
and the early presided over a great deal of massacres, rape and slavery actually.
there is no such thing as marital rape in islam.
yes holding it up for some reason.
okay so who was raped and warlord ? you have been reading too much out of context material
about as nice as the bible.
but no one is stoning babies in 2015. move on from that one
maybe a qualified scholar like abe bar al-baghdadi, who has a phd in islamic studies.
the eu'ran is the word of god, passed down via the angel gabriel to mohammad (pbuh)
the hostage taker is actually just a nut job.
that is the unpalatable truth the right-on brigade continue to skirt round.
i am saying in this picture, specifically, someone does not know how to write syntactical arabic.
turns out hostage taker is iranian, so a ship and implacably opposed to/by isis.
from some comments i read u would think most islamist wants to have us over for tea.
now how many believe the'an to be the infallible command of allah ?
last time i checked that was not in the duran, women are highly respected. +
never mind crusade what about cia interrogation !
you forget the history if the crusades !

seems like it. they do not seem to be too concerned about hostages.
but some just do not get it.
right. a matter of opinion. i certainly would not be putting him/them in that category ta tho

no one intelligent denies either. any other straw men you feel like taking down ?

breaking news : flag in sydney cafe window confirmed to be that of jabah al-nusra , says islamic terror expert
how do you even call yourself muslims you syrian terrorist twats hope you liquidate asap
wait tell us again why torture is bad against scum isis and al queen ?? why ?
must suck not to have open or concealed carry.
of all types use this flag.
did not and side with this group in to fight against the assad regime ?
wow so sad to see. hate how terrorists ruin the name of all muslims.
its not just them. its sunni islamist in general.
was not b. in australia recently ? where is obama been lately ?
the female on the left is just a kid ! very young. sad.
do not give him but a. 308 in the chest.
it is not jab ah. and there is cross over between al nasa and isis.
black islamic flag being held up in window of chocolate store in martin place , sydney - hostages inside .
green is the traditional color. presumptions are worthless
so just generic terrorists. that is a relief
i hope everyone gets out safely.
almost every media outlet for the first 20 minutes until people remembered how google works
flag is a generic flag, not unique to any group. isis uses a different flag
ah i see. the having nothing to do with the koran. got you.
yes. and if yes would suggest less chance of a larger group.
doing what their man made twisted fairy tale tells them to do.
get the snipers out and exterminate
who typed ? islamic flag was used in the original tweet.
so we still not sure of the motivation for the attack ?
but its such a peaceful religion /s
: it is understood the gunman has demanded a meeting with the australian pm .
i am unsure never been in a hostage situation probably dolphin friendly tuna and onion
more terrorists in than any other religion üëç
he would probably be better off talking to russ abbott than that dozy knob.
well of course that is realistic .....
the stereotypical supporter sticking up for islam low
yes because this is definitely islam is fault and not just a group of fucking lunatics ..... moron
its ' gazillion dollars ' now, inflation.
the teenage socialist that thinks he can placate islam.
wrong. they are not in ‚Äú islam because muslims do not uphold what they are doing.
oral lassitude rt low the teenage socialist that thinks he can placate islam.
so just refused terrorist and cruel halal certification ?
to learn who rules over you simply find out who you are not allowed to criticism.
oh yeah if you was a terrorist guy what topping would you have ?
i would still ask for that and pizza.
but from a pizza shop about 7000 miles away otherwise what is the point of making demands ?
flown in from new york.
the bombs he has will be set off if he is killed
. it is understood the gunman has demanded a meeting with the pm.
this could not be any more of a false flag ! omgosh ... do not be fooled ! staged
why do not they just let the police snipers take the shot and get rid of the scum.?
you are a skip voter so i will just leave it at that tba.
what happened to the helicopter and a million in used notes generation ?
just looking out for the dolphins
this is the islamic state flag , not the one in the window in sydney .
do you know what one says ?
says there is no god but allah and muhammad is his passenger
. do we know if this flag is of a known design ? of a known group ?
it has been suggested this is the sahara ?
indeed its a standard shahadah flag in the window !
been told it is the sahara
in short if it looks like comic sans arabic, it is probably isis.
oh they are probably well meaning then
truly pathetic that professional are getting this wrong. sigh
this is also the flag of asap, al-shabab aim and a
probably is the flag
they probably just could not get their hands on an isis flag in time to mount the operation.

i am watching it on tv. it is really terrible, is not it ?
the lindt store refuses to be halal certified perhaps thats why they were targeted .
where is all the protest against all this savagery. silence screams approval.
so all are guilty of killing innocent iraqi/ afghan/ pakistani ppm ?
funny the majority countries are doing all the bombings but it is the muslims that are terrorists.
why is the bombing happening ? is it possible that it is a reaction to islamic barbaric actions ?
halal needs to be outlawed. businesses that do it need to be boycotted.
lack of media coverage or you looking it up has more to do with the apparent silence.
then do not associate with criminals. judged by company you keep.
what does kosher have to do with the in the window ?
their was a list of companies that were halal compliant.
so that probably also means veterinarian. yay for me !
subway will not provide san wipes anymore b/c of alcohol in them. enough is enough.
as for leaving the country. think that is an extreme reaction over alcohol wipes.
for all veterinarians that have ever committed a crime ? or every women ? or achiest ?
kill their animals the same way as kosher. only kosher outright refuse to stun first.

how considerate of you genuine, thank you so much
and the were not christian. it did not stop until the public started condemning it.
he also likes to call people faggots, retards, and trolls, because he feels inferior.
does he now he is a naughty boy indeed, is not he ?
the actions are religiously motivated and its important condemn these antisocial bits of their religion
because the bible did not have similar in it ? you bunch of loons
it has been reported that the hostages are holding up flags with the sahara (islamic affirmation)
instead of outrage that their kids are being brainwashed, the parents close up and claim victimization.
please do not call me a fool how peaceful and tolerant
eye for an eye is about limits on justice, not on retribution.
is a complex situation with a mix of fear and sympathy guiding behavior.
wow immediately insulting how peaceful and tolerant ! logic outside of your grasp ?
bullet resistant up to what caliber ?
regardless. if you are rude and offensive towards a kind of people then you are a racist
you proved words. and what you see in islam is what you see in old testament.
ha huh and who says religion is all about having ‚Äú fun ' ????
depends which ones you are referring to.
good brief you really have no idea of history do you ?
that is yes.
you need to look harder.
can you be my tutor please and teach me about bigotry and racism as well ??
another mad bastard with a scarf round his face
maybe tell the 30-40 people held at gunpoint in sydney that they should stop focusing on the negative ?
what actions do you suggest ? forehead tattoos saying ' i am a nice one ' ?
no you are quite expert at it.
you are denying it now ? or were u just trying to suck up to the racist girl ??
and inspector over here call that bigotry, marisa miss empathy
what actions are doing to show they find all stand by the worst excesses of their state ?
nobody said as you well know - a very obvious sleight of hand and fools nobody.
so strange that innocent muslims may get abuse from this but if another religion was involved ...
nice however the world is tax dollars are being used to fight this trash.
never take responsibility always play the victim or blame everyone else
maybe that is because he is self professed, not representative, you clowns
yeah like everything else. there are no bad people only evil governments.
well they probably know that it will be their members that will suffer on the street.
it is a good sign that a person does not have anything to write that is worth reading.
just because someone is interpretation of religion differs from yours does not make it any less religious
apparently the glass in most of the buildings around there is bullet resistant.
he does understand. to cover his embarrassment he is trying to stone us to death with snow
that is assuring against repressive laws as being counter productive, not supporting terrorism.
not sure what you mean by that but israelis protest against their government all the time.
it matters com now everyone is like ;. & lt ; are which is not true
because its important for to be able to define what should be and not ignore its problems ?

u should said that to yo self be4 making all those false accusations
it is like talking to a child.
denying what my knowledge of english and the difference between racism and bigotry ?
for referring to me with one of the great minds in history who debunked the creation myth !
i found in counter magnum sniper gun can penetrate most of the glasses used in buildings
so you agree that muslims waging jihad in syria are comparable to jewish aussies joining the if ?
most cases terrorists harbored by same muslim groups, who later claim innocence
i heard that the glass is bullet resistant
are these guys more maybe ?
groups condemn in statement : ‚Äú this is a time for all australians to stand together ‚Äú
your is gods a douche bag low i can not take you seriously
you only support condemning one group, spreading hate.
well then you better go on the internet and check again :. islam means submission !
by saying something you disagree with ?
i have seen that headband somewhere before ... is it pat cash ?
i am from this is just crazy
someone is making a move !

that planetary vision at him by is that you ?
someone likes to meet you and be thought a lesson ! very sm !
all religions have radicalism and individuals who do unthinkable acts. you only ever seem to have innocent ...
how peaceful and tolerant of you guys, especially marisa, she knows all the right and wrongs
i would just give the guy his on air tv time, that is clearly what he wants
you do not understand things easily, do you ? we already explained the difference with bigotry
meanwhile they are saying what evil people we all are
your reaction is not rational.
by contrasting to you mean ?
you are actually trying to look smart ? lol
do you think my is a coincidence ??
so you can not identify the paid government mi6 employees ... 100% false flag government hoax
i guess he lost the argument ...
no they do not you just chose not to see anything not conforming your own prejudice
because it came across as though you were calling the australian muslim community out, not challenging the bbc
you are just a racist in denial who thinks they are a genuine person low

yeah you are probably right. google is the experts on isis related flags
it is not an is flag a simple google search can show u that.
thanks that is awesome !
no they pretty much show u the flags. but keep going its funny
yes as in a chocolate - cafe and shop.
this is what can happen when guns are banned. evil will prevail unchecked.
that is not an is flag specifically.
how pathetic these poor people !
what does this even mean ? i have studied both is and muslim symbolism.
is just a coffee shop, right ? or is it something else ?
and you are not an authority on what shit is ..... ‚Äú specifically ‚Äú
not the flag being used by isis
works fine for the cameras. does the job
are you joking because yes, i sort of am.
this is totally not the isis flag !

glad i am not the only one who is confused ...
trips out of the cd today are free to help sydneysiders get home safely. see
so is user paying for the rides paying the drivers ?
so are rides free or more expensive ? your tweet is very unclear
trying to get in anyone at the phones ?
faster back flip than tony abbott !
hikes prices during the. how is that helping ? giving away free rides would help.
trips out of the cd today are free to help sydneysiders get home safely. see
being literate in economics is out of favor these days. bad for politics.
when you first became aware of the situation you tweeted that prices will increase.
does ' higher rate ' mean what is paying drivers ?
thanks user i got everyone here at work now downloading your app
is covering the cost of all rides, drivers will still receive higher rates from user
no idea what you mean ?
i see your point. maybe should make transport free from the cd today.
the rides are free. will be paying the drivers the increased rate out of their own pocket.
but you do user for trying to increase drivers. my work here is done your honor.
swarming because of a concert or event ? fine. swarming during a hostage crisis ? not cool.
is covering the cost of all rides.
is covering the cost of all rides.
well that is not true. first, you tweeted an explanation about why you were gouging customers.
thank you for fixing this situation.

initial message did imply that riders can cop hike. much better.

did not make it very clear in the beginning.
listen up dumdum. they are paying the drivers more. reading is a skill.
what is the wait time for a ride out of the sydney cd ?
you are aware that this tweet ... is giving away free rides, right ?
so free or surge pricing ?

people should be kind to each other and live together no matter which religion.
not a great comfort but an important detail to emphasis.
along with all life hating alan vomit jones listeners too, that would help, the redneck brigade.
so its not an is flag - must be a peaceful islamic extremist group then !
it is according to this terrorism expert
then i guess we all do not need to worry ???
go get the thugs now !!!
support a to avoid giving the hostage takers a platform for their message & amp ; risking future copycats

you are spreading lies. i know the answers.
your hatred for milk gets you blocked.
i was wondering why you were discussing this on the hostage ha stag.
your inability to reason gets you called an idiot.
the attorney general who bugged and harassed milk was bobby kennedy.
not denying but still false equivalency. southern democrats very diff than current
your in self published format does not make it better
so and at water = liberal hogwash. i agree
that is not true. google southern strategy
i see. now he is your hero ? please.
them claiming to be does not make it so. they are mostly atheists, actually.
here is milk is opinion ‚Äú = = sgt ;
your complete lack of education is revolting
should not have been referred to that way.
the associates the with christianity
it was president is attorney general who bugged and harassed milk.
talked about people ‚Äú ?
looks like you found a moron.
is denied the southern strategy ever happened
the came from the democrat party. google it and then get back to me.
completely ignorant of political history.
did not belong to any political party other than hoover ism
the came from the democrat party. the kkk terrorized blacks and republicans.
except you are a victim of democrat spin, . so sad.
the was terrorist wing of the democratic party. see
no shit. she cites facts and gives her opinion. you claimed waco was fact.
my books ends with the clinton administration.
you confuse fact and opinion. but it is expected from the left. opinion trumps all
so basically you are saying milk was retarded ?
that is absurd. very much associate themselves with christian identity.
except the
i could not agree more. buh bye
pointing out basic logical fallacy (false equivalency) . well documented racial probe in the south
southern strategy and provide source for lbj quote other than lesser
did you southern strategy ?
how about him he is an idiot.
chain is also an opinion writer
yikes i have been arguing with a 10yr old.
do not the refer to themselves as ‚Äú conservative christians ‚Äú or some formula like that ?
did you even read it ? i read the waco opinion blog. it is all opinion.
is strong with that one. i guess it 2 hard 4 her to search congressional record.
what do you think is going to come to your aid ?
why are you denying that the democrat party formed the kkk ???
i truly do not understand it.
i believe the would consider themselves white supremacists rather than christian supremacists.
even attributing such an insult to milk to someone else is vile.
low at the idiot trying to equate islam with the ‚Äú chricons, the kkk ‚Äú
take your bigotry elsewhere. it is repulsive and sickening.

i fear this is not going to end well.
they are against obesity and how chocolate causes it, right ?
well. reports no missing. if that helps authorities.
i hope the was fills those terrorists with lead.
still say we need an ump loom pa swat team. small causalities that way,
i would bet money on it.
reliance of the traveler. jihad means 2 war angst non-muslims.
just explaining that jihad is one thing, murder another.
i am clear what is going on. thanks for your concern
but the comments were directed at the very sensible reporting.
that is funny. really and not historically accurate, but funny.
over there with him.
you pick up their colors and do their deeds ; you are one of them.
very there were raids this morning and other things earlier but - we need the facts.
you are right amp ; a lot of them follow.
i certainly hope the terrorist holding this ppm hostage is as empathetic as these bleeding hearts are.
i think it is some dirt of chocolate shop. sugar deprivation ?
or the omnibus bill no one read
black flag saying is god
i like my where shit usually is what you think it is.
for the hostages and the was
looks that way to me at this point but no expert.
i should not laugh.
now maybe the poor deranged jihads is feeling a bit misunderstood ....
the anti water board freaks are pulling for the terrorists.
do not judge not everyone waving a jihad flag while holding people at gunpoint is a terrorist !
a live feed can be found here
now we are talking '.
i share your fear ... and i am angry at the same time.
just ... no matter what they call themselves ...
then every hostage act is a terrorist act, whether islamic or home grown crime.
we have to stop throwing the world terrorist around so freely.
then what do you propose is the right definition ?
it was a bad coffee joke.
.... or is anxious to meet his 72 virgins !
it is not complex at all.
i thought it was from that group ‚Äú ira burma nutzbaghs ‚Äú
terrorist are terrorist there is not doubt about it. they do have feelings if they get caught.
i want the sniper is bullet to fly true !
all problems in the world today can be solved with a sniper rifle
can you see his underwear ?
just a misunderstood person ..... who happens to want to chop your head off ....
bunny ... stop stereotyping. not all terrorists are they same deranged sociopaths
we need to understand and empathize with the terrorists ... duh !! just ask hilary !
yes and that is why ft hood was called ' workplace violence '
a jihad against perhaps ?
do not you know you racist !. ‚Äú terrorist lives matter. ‚Äú. lol
the easiest way to pronounce that is to stick your fingers down your throat
i think any hostage situation requires full knowledge of the facts before anyone does anything.
that is possible. he just needs a sharp point to the head for us to understand him !
unconfirmed fact.
you are on a roll tonight !
a bad joke never killed anyone.
murderers often use religion as an excuse to murder.
so we just wait until he decides to kill someone. gotcha.
jihad religious not killing.
they make backpacks large enough for hostages ?
some right wing us paramilitary groups too.
the flag is from a jihads group - do you know what a jihad is ?
maybe a customer ordered a large coffee & amp ; offended them
someone does terrible things to cause terror is a terrorist
oh it is probably full of gideon bibles, march of dimes info, maybe some baby chipmunks.
and chocolate shop that is what makes it even worse.
right. what do you think is happening ? armed robbery ? smh
. but make sure you pronounce it rights !
jihad is jihad is jihad. what is the purpose of jihad ?
we all sit here worried that they r gonna crucify us. puhleeze !
locking down all us consulate evacuated americans told to be on high alert.
but great timing !
maybe. probably not a. 308 coattail round though.
probably out of abundance of caution over there but feels like more is going on.

what part of jihads flag are you trying to protect ? and why ?
but dark chocolate only.
maybe u sold research axle rod & amp ; bill ayers obama pals guilty of terrorist acts
was the terrorist in question waving a flag representing a jihads group ?
well sure if you behead them.
semantics. devotees doing their bloodthirsty god a solid.
well why do not we just send hillary right on over to sydney to sympathize with those hostage takers
will be interesting to see this unfold, aussies do not play around
not everyone who does something fucked up is a terrorist.
my purpose is to eliminate fucking jihad !
calling them terrorists is considered torture now. get with the times bunny. terrorists have feelings too.
what do we have for the winner ? --- sgt ;
what do you think it is ? workplace violence ? lol
true. some of them are in congress.
the sniper better wait for a frontal shot. because it could contain obamacare bill
college books his hands were up !!! oh wait wrong story
what do you think is in his backpack, sparky ?
secondary event to ensure good coverage ? something does not fit right yet.
a jihad against a coffee shop jihad ? damn decaf !
yeah .... he probably just has his child bride stuffed in there.
i sure.
yea because only the tea party are the real terrorists. oh mm gee
let is shoot him and find out.
the i knew it !
you are an awesome intel analyst.
yes. merging with ....
you may have to break out the puppets for this one.
flag used in belongs to extremist group jab hat al-nusra (thanks)
tells us to sympathize with them ......... gee
here is something to research sweetie. & gt ; & gt ; & gt ; sarcasm
it is a generic black sahara flag. terrorist cud favor any jihad group @ this point.
they were offering 2 for 1 on pumpkin spice latte.
i do not recall a t parties beheading anyone or bombing innocents like obama is pals do
that was for. there on my part.
more than 12 hours on , night falls on sydney as hostages remain inside cafe .
more than 12 hours on, night falls on sydney as hostages remain inside cafe.
yup non is thread by person who take a religion too serious
more than 12 hours on, . as hostages remain inside cafe. ‚Äù
my heart goes out to friends in sydney going through this. cc/ :
let is hope it ends soon with no casualties
number of hostages taken by the amish today : zero . & lt ; -- this is what a religion
my point exactly. the religion of peace ‚Äú everyone does talk about beheads ppm every day.
i am also happy with religions of more-or-less honorable war, like jews and lutherans.
who cares who is talking about amish ?
the scumbag has demanded an isis flag. but it has nothing to do with islam low.
what is that even supposed to mean ?
not promoting just noting that there are actual religions of peace.
' was on the flag ... and religion is got nothing to do with it ?
we do not behead along with hundreds / thousands of other groups i believe.
only problem with ambush they refuse to fight for their country.
do not forget , at this moment , there are thousands of muslims in australia rejoicing
only crap is from you luvvie
and i did not mean aussie !!! ns
what are you judging we do not know facts, other than there are hostages.
it is either sharia or democracy. until this happens, you will have such terrorist attacks.
some of us are ... most of the are not.
simpleton commentators rush to say muslims ‚Äú disown ‚Äú rather than revere jihads.
spare a thought 4 million jihad victims : chinamideastusaukcan. thai. philippinesindia
is it not a fact that many people are not rejoicing right now ? we know shit all.
what a great time for a ‚Äú mosque open day ‚Äú or ‚Äú wear a hi jab ‚Äú.
and there are more not. now is not the time for baseless crap.
more to the all over the world !
i say we go to lakemba n blow up their mosques
if you look at places like pakistan, even sharia is no guarantee against terrorist attacks
not enough room for spain, italy, germany, burma, indonesia, etc.
now you will see how strong the prime minister is this could happen here. are we prepared ?
insanity ! comes 2 australia & amp ; liberal lunatics are concerned with political correctness !?
thought this was in not egypt !?!?
is the administration coordinating the aussie talking points ? sound like it.
far as we know beta does not use a flag like that
a noisy are party ????
appear amp ; australia had sum tinge in common : pc, terrorists racism etc
liberal political correctness is a crock of crap and has no place in the world period
via comes 2 & amp ; lib lunatics are concerned with political correctness !? ‚Äú
just shoot the bastards !
no i think they are being cautious for sake of hostages
head up ass or in sand ... how incredibly dense & amp ; blind are these people ?!
the art of nothing to see here ! so ridiculous
today the threat of terrorism is higher than it was 3 yrs ago , a result of support for terror
divide the to gain more information. abeldanger surmises, only 100 knew full details before.
its a war. instigated by us for political/commercial gain. criminal.
this is as real as isis.
those who knew of the 9/11 plot beforehand, need to speak out or be hanged.
end of topic for me. keep the faith patriot.
oops you accident typed or ‚Äú when you meant ‚Äú then ‚Äú.
buff said. nice chatting with you.
what goes around comes around. pakistan has not learned as yet.
there are tens of options to induce cooperation.
protecting the drug trade and 9/11 secrets, cia tortures to instill fear, not to gain information ?
is a whole. it was surprising he talked against the us at is recently.
why is not this guy tried for treason ?
praying for sydney . also thank heavens for streaming foreign networks because american media is completely mia .
and do not forget twitter too !
new stalk 954 is giving good coverage
thank god for technology and social media. would not know about this otherwise ...
was stunned by that. finally just went live
have they moved to baby seals from the viral video report ? heavens.
kind of disgusting how no one is breaking in.
too bad they do not have concealed carry in australia.
how useful is really ?
we are all praying for the people of sydney !
that is not fair. said that there is a police incident. that is all.
can not find anything about it.
as they will not report because they have been making muzzles look like the victims.
thinking about all my mates in sydney . hope everyone is okay .
yes i have family up there, all my thoughts and prayers are with them ‚ù§Ô∏è
me please i love you
respect to the people of sydney for showing us that solidarity is the best way to deal with extremism
really all i have seen are racist comments both on twitter and facebook
which bit do not you understand ?
people can not see what is right in front of them ... thanks for looking though
cough and * cough *
the woman who inspired the # is from sydney. the woman who started the # is from melbourne
you will be siding with the extremists then, eh ?
in the 12 hours everyone has focused on the hostage situation in sydney 40 more americans died from gunshots .
8 percent of them would have failed because of the success rate of the method.
amp they would be wrong
i somehow doubt the dead people care.
a good fair point. do u have personal knowledge each was a suicide ?
psychology is completely opinion based : ‚Äú it goes against the desired or perceived norm ... ‚Äú = bs
even in notable gun control countries suicide rates comparable, still exists no magic solution
and obviously guns are only used to murder. and only people killed by guns are really dead.
unlike there are a responses' fa homicide ? prosecution : costly, incarceration : bad optics
good point. what about legality of method ? of everyone who shot themselves hung themselves ...
facts as if you have firsthand knowledge that each of those deaths were suicide ? puleeeeez
yet gun murder a 9/11 death toll every 4 months.
brilliant defense of guns .... ignorance is alive and well
do they i have never investigated. the overall gun injuries must be less, surely.
have to bow it is late here in the southern hemisphere thank you.
320 a 100,000 a year ? i suppose that is possible ...
lethality not legality sorry. not trying to be argumentative i really want your opinion.
so could this one guy. what is your point ?
far more people perish due to poisoning or falls, 2x in me accidents since ' 99. perspective
that is the impression i have from here.
men are more likely to use violent means of suicide, and are more likely to
the psychological association would disagree with that.
gun deaths are nearly always intentional, an ‚Äú accident ‚Äú by definition is not.
no psychology is empirically based and accounts for cultural and societal norms.
by fixating on gun deaths ‚Äú, that is exactly what is trying to imply.
larger chance of failing in their suicide attempt. less dead people with less violent means
except shows us your hypothesis is false :
do you really think someone who is trying to kill themselves cares about the legality of the method ?
about homicide.
hopefully the hostages make it out in one piece !
and 168 will have died in traffic accidents.
it is like people want to parade their ignorance of statistics today.
intentional suicide is neither unlawful nor easily preventable - by any means.
exactly. actually shows us suicide substitution is real - more people hang themselves there.
i would rather they fail and get the help they need.
unreal ..... if it were not so real
and why should the government intervene ?
i do not think anyone is saying that.
people make choices you do not agree with. that does not mean they ‚Äú need help ‚Äú.
in our take care.
pointing out a fact is somehow ‚Äú ignorance ‚Äú ? and war is peace, right ?
is that right more suicide than other gun deaths ?
i did not realism how devastating.
they are doing to try. the question is if they are going to succeed.
if people choose to kill themselves, i would rather they be effective than disfigured/maimed for life.
i think people who want to kill themselves are going to.
succeed because of it. if men used pills or something like most women, they would have a
hats off to you guys , you are awesome , faith in humanity restored
love love to these guys !!!

i love this great work everyone that is helping others feel save ‚ù§Ô∏èüíã
something wonderful between and non-muslims is coming out of this atrocity.
wow i did not think about that
neither but i am glad to see the humanity.
so heartwarming say it loud, say it clears, racists are not welcome here.
indeed. well done citizens.
say it say it clears, racists are not welcome here. via
i nearly cried reading that. üò¢‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
hats off to you guys, you are awesome, faith in humanity restored ‚Äù kudos
feeling humanity and love. feeling safe. never thought i would have to say that now.
when the 5 hostages escaped , the gunman could be seen from here getting extremely agitated , shouting at remaining
if 1 sane and 10 = arrogant, self centered fuck wit you = 14 ...
this is irresponsible journalism. the journalist should have some consideration for family and friends of the hostages.
shoot the terrorist first then the police commissioner and his deputy next for incompetence.
you are accusing people of rubbernecking a terrorist attack ?
he need a dead man switch
too right. hopefully all others will be ok
the media drives home the narrative and conditions the viewer. works like a charm.
hes known to police so there will be questions
yeah maybe. all will be revealed.
either way that is the end result for sure
hi could you take a short call from bbc ? thanks
probably because he is lining the windows with civilians - any shooting would injure them as well !
that is very thoughtful of you, thanks.

is likely being carried out by a ' lone wolf ' with minimal links to organized terror groups , expert
been too many lone wolves ‚Äú lately.
two soldiers were murdered in canada in november by lone wolf jihadists. it is not either/or.
so the narrative begins what say you ?
did he write the book ‚Äú hostage terrorist, terrorist hostage ‚Äú ?
he wants publicity that is it ... just shoot the sob
dirty not innocent civilians w/ causing radar. west coast too ! ban !!!
lone wolf why not call out as it is ? islamic terrorist !!!
does it help amp ; make one feel better ? it is a terror attack nonetheless
witness said he was threatened by 2 jihads - is mm again afraid to name
then further minimalist the risk by taking him out !!
sydney siege ends as police storm lindt cafe and hostages run out
and what are you lot worried about the muslims

thats true patriots ' rt ‚Äú : australians use hash tag in solidarity with muslims during sydney siege
what about the damn hostages ?
you are one classy people.
thats true patriots australians use hash tag in solidarity with muslims during sydney siege ‚Äú
what what about the people being held at gun point in the freaking coffee shop ?
i thought its hostages who need solidarity

yes we are c among over !
use in solidarity with muslims during sydney siege ‚Äù so proud to be aussie today !
hey speak for buddy !
australia is reaction to the is magnificent

living only away from this situation, is scaring the hell out of me. pray for us
seems like ... i think they want peace ?
and the right to carry handguns
takes 2 sides for peace. the side that preaches peace gets beheaded. isis must be destroyed
all we need is love !
it is bad hearing this happens more so when you live where it is happening
sydney attack latest : - 16th hour - 5 people escaped gunman demands : - speak to pm - isis
there is 2 gunmen if one gets taken out the other will take out the rest of the hostages
i am sorry early reports said 1 but i was not updated
early reports said 2 i meant
one shooter in only place i was talking about.
have had multiple opportunities to kill the bastard with a sniper. wtf wrong with them ?
the perpetrators target all citizens , irrespective of their faith . so please cut it out with the anti-muslim bigotry
criticizing constitutes bigotry ?
perpetrator definitely not a ship. ponder that now.
is behind this terrorist attack is that anti-muslim bigotry or truth in reporting ?
and i am not entertaining them either
yes unfortunately such bigotry does not really rely on rational thinking.
that is true. extremists kill their fellow muslims a lot.
and where do these terrorists get the idea that they can commit terror in the name of religion ?
who gives a kill these as the enemy they are !
bigots now have an excuse to express and voice how they really feel as a result of this.
why not wait until facts are known ?
but religion yes that relies on rational thinking, cut mo flew on a magic horse ...
the backlash and - on social media and on the ground - will only increase.
if there is anyone i am blaming here, it is the terrorists. no one else.
loses its sting when you have been called and infidel.

where did i say all muslims are murderers ?
problem i have just been invited to join the conservative party ...
feel free to berate the noble sentiment of nationalism - it has killed way more people.
just like ordered his followers to murder people.
you may as well bring up the harmfulness of cocaine to defend pcp.
any angry could do this - religion is just an excuse for them
... attacks would be a terrifying scenario for the world to deal with because it is largely unstoppable.
so why are you still breathing if as you said all muslims 1 billions 700000 millions are murderers idiot
which therefore should indicate that there is something fundamentally wrong within the ideology .... no ?
ever the penny pinching sensationalist !
i where did i say all muslims are murderers ?
sydney muslims say thanks ! via
but we can not have an opinion on this remember ! we need to be politically correct ! .....
and you too go live with the lovely friendly muslim people in syria
block him not worth it
she loves terrorists she should be in jail !
if you know you would know that idiot aussies told rhodesian to give their country to the natives
in this hour of when two innocent had died, only a sick mind will regale.
do also say ‚Äú thanks ‚Äú for the deaths of hostages ?
is this the same race responsible for the 80 children dead in pakistan this morning ????
agree ... what a dumb hack
support for those in religious garb : muslims say thanks !
no civilized people care if muzzles are targeted or harassed
your mistake was saying terrorist with a gun - he was a muslim terrorist with a gun
yep. have done more coming. more blocks. awful people about.
but as long as they all get home safe on public transport then everything is ok ?
please go live with your lovely peaceful muslims friends in syria
2 die in but muslims victims ? like to offer condolences to families of those that died.
talk is where are the protests disowning the gunman ? would have thousands if the other way
where is the outrage from ‚Äú moderate ‚Äú muslims ? when is the first mass rally against planned ?
did you protest against break or do you support him ?
talk about having priorities in check
mt in the process of creating a web app to help make easier for people.
listen geyser. how about you just fuck the hell off and clean your tommie green teeth.
do you know rhodesia ? hmm ?
amazing the amount of trolls this has brought out
it really is religion of peace read the duran
maybe because you are not listening ?
do not make silly comments like that ! islam is a religion of peace
usually come out in their thousands when something effects them
and a coward to block and look who is a racist now
. you are a disgrace. fuck off !
they have nothing else to do.
yet another intelligent lefty liberal with intelligent words and retorts - wow !
nope ..... all nice normal types
so you say thanks but i do not hear anyone saying anything against the hostage taker
well the two innocent victims are at peace now i guess.
always about the have some respect you heartless cow !!!
you mean this same in france, england, the us.
if they lost family to the peaceful religion of islam maybe they would be not so ignorant ?
yeah no problem with islam is there.
muslim- a follower of the religion of islam . terrorist- a person who engages in inhumane and violent acts .
you did not answer have you read the duran
terrorist. never forget the web
does not mean there is sh wrong with islam
you know what i want the original citation in arabic that says that
what does narcissism have to do with it ?
did you or did you not read the duran ?
block i am a muslim & amp ; he is a liar !
and you deserve to die you ugly piece of trash
you are not even you do not know what is written in duran so shut the fuck up
you off terrorist and pedophile desert cult follower. you all deserve to be locked up in guantanamo bay
sometimes i wonder whether a brain is even left or just a program denying endlessly
i know really cause i am muslim too üíû
you are still showing me what isis did, not what the duran says
why and can grow in any ideology ? read here :
the is principles are against this all
this is not the have you read the duran
you are the one denying and not giving me scientific rational arguments
seems the mirror of truth is really puncturing your narcissism gone awry
i have to congratulate you on your capacity to deny and keep denying
you are still not giving me the exact references
mind yr language evidently you do not know how to read the duran
well they are killing children now
i meant how the terrorist wrongly accuse the duran and blame it for why they are terrorist.
i am a and that does not make me a terrorist.
on which your tweet is based ?
they use the duran as an excuse to terrorism. ‚Äù yes
you know people beg to differ to all the things you dude are saying just fuck off
please mind own bigness
says it is kofr to even tell a person they are air
the media fed you about islam
i am an you dumb fuck have you read tue duran ?
they use the as an excuse to terrorism.
yeah i am so done with them üíî
its 1st hand application - islamist stole everything from us - then bomb attacks 26/11 etc
wrong the said that nobody specially a muslim can kill this is harm ! islam is peace
australian pm tony abbott says it is unclear if is politically motivated
well there is a huge isis flag so pretty sure it is terrorism and politically motivated.
unclear politically motive ‚Äú was homer simpson made aussie pm ?
then brace yourself for the cries of.
it is time we banned this backwards religion.
technically that flag appears to suggest it is religious, not political.
they will not ever have any success with me, on that issue.
did not he sees the flag ????????????!!!
. probably because he is an idiot.
with these it is like a mix ...
yes that flag was very unclear ...
he basically confirmed that after 3 hours, he has no idea on what is going on
when will people admit there is a muslim problem
did u identify the religion of the flag at the sport com some of media outlets informed that ?
with this it is a mix indeed. there. i said it.
why should today be any different
there are indications it could be. ‚Äú
you just kill all terrorist people who have been attracted there.
and that is why it happened, mr. abbott ! wise up for crying ' out loud !
. sydney , you are amazing
this just shows how our country can stand together throughout anything. i am proud to be australian tonight
you are amazing ‚Äù
reflection of what the people are really about. such an awesome communal initiative üëç
this is honestly amazing. even through the ups and downs we still stick together.
can we add daily telegraph to suspected terror cells within aus ? their 2pm edition did more damage than any
that is why it is referred to as the terror graph ...
add most of the mainstream media too.
very well and a solid point ....

u need to stop believing media reports embellishing certain cases here-n-there.
also rayon martin. no gun.
what is your pt did that give rayon the ok to attack
like i have said self defense is fine. preemptive shooting the likes of and is not
you think us police have never dealt w/hostage situations ?
i have been getting a lot of beef for posting that tweet -__-
so you are saying cops should not defend themselves ? why ? us should let thugs rule ?
well try harder ... do not be another sheep.
not saying but look at ferguson/tamer rice
yes they do. us police look terrible to other nations.
if demonstrating yes. preemptively ? that is my issue.
man haron monis , named as the gunman , may have a " fetish for self-publicity " .
the sooner we deport this man the better ... up on a string of other charges as well

i was worried. i thought he might be a terrorist.

if those hostages could wait for 16 hours without knowing if they would die , you can wait for an
as opposed to jumping to conclusions and believing rumors. so disrespectful.
remember not all media has ! just certain channels and publications.
what is even worse is the people taking series at the site !
yeah the media is hungry for click bait/sensationalist material in order to sell advertising, nothing new
shame the massive boost society has got from is just eroded from acts like this.
what i feel ill. that is actually putrid.
yeah i agree and even that newspaper too ! i think it was daily telegraph.
quite sad surely human decency comes above boosting one is social media profile ?
thank you it is really getting ridiculous now.
again well said ... utter heart breaking
yeah i know character limit prevented me from detailing who in the media is culpable.

cnn has not been able to rule out the sydney tea party in the australian hostage crisis .
i can confirm has ruled out michael brown as the undocumented hostage taker.
possibly clinging to god & amp ; guns that did it.
not either i am 90% sure.
ads to list of things i am going to hell for laughing ...
oh god. i hope this is not real
how can they rule out anything if they have not been covering it ?
i heard some southern state fraternity was involved, but that is just pure speculation.
not funny. lives are at stake.
you just cost me a mouthful of beer ... well played !!
am patiently waiting for the to blame bush for this.

bbc is frank gardner on : " this is not a sophisticated siege ... the gunman has got the wrong
so far above we can only guess.
no of course not just annoys me people automatically tag the event as directly related to and
maybe that is the point of the operation.
up to no good if you ask me !
i am thinking the west has pushed this one too far to enable establishment in near future
does not make it any lighter of a matter to be dealt with
has always been involved in all conflicts in and - oz public now realizing the cost

maybe they had just sold out of them in the deadest shop
very good question. no end game plan ? or something more sinister ?
not but they are religious lunatics
there is a plan far above our pay grades

it was a calculated gamble without any plan b

you say not all muslims are monsters . imagine a bowl of m & amp ; ms. 10% are poisoned
does not apply to ship. not close.
true ... most of the rest are progressives/ socialists/ communists. good point ...
so like what hat did you pull that 10% figure from ?
damn sure do not wanna give that moron any sort of win.
and you are utterly refuted. .... shiites and their black flags.
a large portion of are terrorist supporting scumbags any way you slice it.
we will use the maximum. 20%.
was not surveyed. get the hell over it, weirdo.
why no scores for us uk russia china etc ? would they be similar ?
you are only of terrorists are muslims. my bad.
of support i rounded down.
you actually don not know what the flag is, and it has to. period.
you eat ew.
terribly flawed data presented in illiterate manner that distorts it even more is shitty data.
you may want to delete and rewrite your tweet
almost all terrorism is muslim.
the point you have evaded is that it is mainstream opinion among global islam to support terrorism.
why was excluded from the poll ? how large is their population ?
why is excluded also statistically stupid to take the median when these nations have different populations.
i have taken 2 semesters of stats and 5 econometric courses. but again, irrelevant.
the flag is the flag of khoisan and applies to all sects. period.
you can not take the median here and less than 1% of iranians support al ada.
fuck terrorists are not just muslims
how about you it was presented in the most flattering of terms for you possible, jihad whore
friendly reminder .
how many want sharia law ?
i think it was 70 or 80 in one poll i saw.
those sympathetic to isis and book harm 1+ billion
so the majority of want the same thing as the terrorists.
friendly reminder.
its the case of a few rotten tomatoes
i was under the impression terrorist groups do not follow any religion

an atheist all religion should be abolished they are all fiction and lies made to control stupid people
may the hostage taker have been shot by 1 of this pork covered bullets.
true. but without algebra we would still be measuring right angle triangles to calculate square roots.
how do you know it was not muslims who did this ?
is against extremism and the killing of innocent people you see is the opposite of the media
no sir you turks fought against australia in ww1 and collaborated with hitler in ww2
your governments of supporting terrorism in iraq and syria, you just dupes believe what is being said

they mean no then escort them safely.
what other religion encourages killing innocent people and beheading them etc the duran was clearly the devils book
there are a kill in the name of islam, they are not muslims

first what this terrorist did was declared his faith by with a sahara on it
the terrorist is a fundamentalist - the other 476,000 muslims in australia are not.
if the black flag seems familiar , it is because it was also flying during gaza protests in sydney that
both were caused by and the other race batters/incompetents.
obviously this guy has no idea like so many.
no ... the flag was noticed during gaza war ... that is when government should have acted
that is not an extremist flag. you are ill informed mate !
i despise both and muslim jihadists
you did not take my tweet as sarcastic
assholes need to be deported ! pronto !
thanks for sharing i have highlighted you on my
as i said yesterday nothing to do with religion. just a fucking deranged man.
an sympathizer is my guess al nurse is main goal to overthrow assad.
hey you forgot to blame the evil jews for ferguson & amp ; ebola too.
is it it is ? rite ?
funny we did not see that on tv
but be nice to terrorists. christopher kitchens and torture
when are western countries going to start sending these muslim bastards back where they came from.
probably just one demented crazy dude ... nothing else
no need to worry ... islam is a religion of peace ....
sure they they just have an us funded military to do it with.
praying for all still being held hostage xxx
praying not gonna do shit
very sad for everyone involved hope everyone stays safe and this whole drama ends soon peacefully ‚ù§Ô∏è
the punters are back taking selfies 100m from the lindt cafe
why. the punters are back taking series 100m from the linda cafe ‚Äù
these people are fucked rt ‚Äú : the punters are back taking series 100m from the linda cafe ‚Äù
yep saw this. some people ...
there‚Äôs no filter to make a siege self look good üòï
she is rocking ' that purple fanny pack with that pick dress, it is coming ' back
watching the news and cannot believe the number of onlookers hanging around ... the shame
perhaps they can arrange to exchange themselves for someone on the inside.
the punters are back taking series 100m from the linda cafe ‚Äù that bum bag tho
sadly can happen to never believed it could happen in sydney. would not go there either
somewhat reminiscent of the photos of the crowds @ lynchings in the states
this is what i am referring 2 go 2 photos 5
appalling. rt the punters are back taking series 100m from the linda cafe
seriously rt the punters are back taking series 100m from the linda cafe
the real crime is the bumbag
complete joke that people are allowed anywhere near the scene.
seems there is a filter that removes a phallus from a forehead
the punters are back taking series 100m from the linda cafe
rt : if the black flag seems familiar , it is because it was also flying during gaza protests in
been around a lot longer than the gaza protests. i just like my hate groups informed
back flag also used by al nasa, who the if helped capture border checkpoint on the golan.
not only in but all over the world.
so could be anything from domestic dispute to gaza to who knows what ?
they should have at least washed the flag.
breaking : police say the hostage situation in the sydney cafe has ended .
has more than a billion followers and a bunch of criminals cannot are doing this.
stupid progressive criminal justice system allowed this guy out on bail despite such serious crimes he was accused of
and i told you read from the beginning 8:1
breaking police say the hostage situation in the sydney cafe has ended. ‚Äù
conceal amp carry is on
breaking police say the hostage situation in the sydney cafe has ended. ‚Äù thugs
explain to me what (8:12) means
the are some of the most evil people on the face of the earth.
us army is the one responsible for this all. they are the bigger terrorist.
come up with solid points. or leave.
i believe in holy duran. and do not follow some random pages.
read it clearly it is about the battle of bad
look what the said about the jews -
breaking police say the hostage situation in the sydney cafe has ended. one cafe !
i did read it from the beginning. it still said the same thing - behead the unbelievers !!!
just reading a and or anti-religious pages does not give you knowledge about islam.
i oppose and all of allah is messengers. all evil and going to hell for eternity
i read it all here it is an evil book.
yes ... wait until they find out the bullets that killed the hostages came from police.
these people portrait them as muslim but they are anti-islamic. they do not belong to islam.
this link is filled with verses from the duran. can you read ?
read the from (8:1) from the beginning (translated)and if you understand english.
two confirmed dead ... ed how long till this happens in usa ... scary is not it
if you say so than prove it ... you know nothing about islam.
us army is responsible for what is happening in iraq, afghanistan, pakistan libya etc.
what is doing with the palestinians. what did the serbs dot the muslims. in bosnia.
you are finally showing some of your true muslim beliefs
not a religion of peace at all - read this to know about true islam
if you do not believe anything do not criticize it until you do not know about it.
you do not believe the duran ? because that is what it is - the duran !!!!!!!
you are showing this video as the palestinians were the one responsible for the holocaust.
hostage situation ongoing in sydney business district . updates : live :
another crazed person promoting by taking hostages and spreading fear.
gunman appears to be using " the wrong flag " says
their just can not believe that it does not say ‚Äú do not tread on me ‚Äú
i think far was can help in this case
but they are not. they call themselves that.
so many bigger narratives at play here but hey, a flag
ah. i do not know who/was that is. sorry
is not a threat to world peace. it is ignorant for you to say this.
then do something about it ! their your people !
he has reportedly asked for an is flag to be brought. this is not an is flag.
it is a swarm sign ? okay, definitely not isis.
please ... is threat to world peace and pakistan is also threat to world peace
new has been sent by allah embrace him as your caliphate
enough about the stupid flag rt : gunman appears to be using ‚Äú the wrong flag ‚Äú
gunman appears to be using ‚Äú the wrong flag ‚Äú says ‚Äù huh ?
how is it known to be the wrong flag, we do not know who this post is representing
we want far was of sheikh aaron monks
according to the twitter handler of isis. you are not real muslim
do not forget that the overwhelming majority of muslims are as disgusted by the actions of these few fanatics as
these people try to hide behind islam to justify themselves
numerous community leaders have condemned acts of terror
that is complete the duran calls christians and jews children of the same god
not fault of as people, but something majorly wrong with that faith that breeds terrorists worldwide
evil doers are always defeated by the inherent goodness of human nature
com that is the most important thing to worry about right now ???
big amen on that my friend
that makes no sense thousands of churches condemn the klein how many mosque say anything or report radicals ?
you prove to me that ignorance has nothing to do with the quality of education. haha.
and that too. the keyword is read and do not stereotype !
those no we don‚Äôt
do not judge the judge the religion
what about the idol worshipers like hindus, buddhists, yazidis etc ?
the do not go around killing muslims. i just think islam as a faith allows for extremism
really read that.
turning people against all is the goal of these people, so they can justify their actions
really why do not they stand uptothe radicals ? cowards or agree with them ?
and that is what i said too, i judge that ideology that is breeding violence wherever it exists
thoughts also with the muslim community whose name and religion has again been hijacked against their will .
it is another example that this religion is a poison to the whole world.
community leader on national tv now denouncing the act publicly. just fyi.
police have allowed me back into martin place newsroom - gunman is clear - white shirt , black cap ,
sounds different to reports of man previously : bald, black bandanna with white text. possibly two ?
translate his headband for us please ?
if you have a clear view can not a sniper have a clear shot at this monsters head ?
seriously a shotgun ?
if you can see him you can also sniper him
thoughts and prayers with you all. stay safe
welcome and stay safe !
if you can see him .... sniper rifle and shoot the prick !
how come u r aloud back in the news room ?
good news stay safe.
you be careful there reason !
surely they can shoot him through the window ?

it is early tuesday in sydney , crisis in 16th hour , as authorities try to secure safe release of
can not believe officials have not designated this event as terrorism. islamic terrorism at that.
is true prime minister is iran khan ..... away sharif is a rigged born baby.
the has identified the guy involved with the sydney sage
crazy man do not you get tired
sort of makes one wonder why he did not take one with him ?
disgusted with and their ‚Äú terror analysts ‚Äú.
no one is trained to do a head shot.
we do not judge their method of doing things. the primary issue is safety
siege gunman identified as man aaron monks -
. if they have the shot, they need to take it with this freak.
praying for the safe release of all
what a coward. hopefully snipers put that red dot on his forehead quickly.
that is the sydney i recognise . rt : this , this is what good people do .
no always good to do so
rt crying standing with my sisters
she is a very real and dear friend of mine, it is copied from her facebook.
cheers for that. i just like to check before i report. many thanks.
have you got proof this is a real tweet ?
thousands tweet declaring their solidarity with muslims
u clearly know nothing about .... go on ; quote urania verses out of context
people in the west start condemning the actions of their governments all over the world ....
most of the jihads are highly is the religion which makes them terrorist.
having faced after this really touched my heart.
the majority of so called moderates will not deal with the minority because they support them.
i leave in a country where questioning is allowed without fear to be hanged for blasphemy.
where are voices against isis beheading ? i hear none ...
they are hoping to continue lying to western society that there are moderate muslims.
there are lots i hear - listen. and i am an atheist not a muslim
solidarity with a religion that clearly state violence against non believers and downgrade women ? no thanks.
we can not put up with them forever
do not have freedom of choice to embrace islam. 2 options : brainwashed or hanged for blasphemy
omg really ?? and we wonder why the world thinks americans are morons .
it is how do they misspell blair from deep ?
mg really and we wonder why the world thinks americans are morons. ‚Äù low üòÇ
we are poorly served by our political and journalistic betters.

kind of moronic to label entire nation because of this too.
an insult to war criminal and a compliment to failure

prayers needed for the situation happening in sydney right now .
never thought it would happen in as
suspicious package sent to opera house and being evacuated. it gets worse.
makes me cringe love .üíõ
i just heard about the situation. praying that no one gets hurt üôèüíó
it is so tragic. heartbreaking. please let them return safely to their families
oh ... please take care !!!!!!!!
what happened w ;
hope everything works out okay there & lt
i am in the city at work. keeping myself updated
what is happening in right now
if there is a sydney-style attack in the u.s. all these anti-cop protests will end in about two seconds .
and with demands to torture them for more information, too.
the media will abandon coverage since it will hurt the narrative.
there is probably never been one. seems unlikely.
oh by god this might be the stupidest thing he is said
cops did a wonderful job preventing boston.
that is the dumbest thing ever written on this garbage website.
maybe the children should have had guns
prevented further attacks what about the initial attack ?
you sound like a pete. please share your solutions to the problem.
every ' lone ' gunmen was also working with the aclu so his tweet checks out
it is an including establishment, mood.
could but the media is not exactly full of rocket scientists either.
this dude is the lord of the mayonnaise boys.
there is a significant mood among the protests.
then it will go from anti-cop and anti-intelligence to ‚Äú well why did not they prevent this ? ‚Äú
blaming the us gov not for things the us gov not does is just more library nonsense
did not stop the first one, but stopped hypothetical ones.
for everyone should have at least 1 gun pointed at them at all times
unless the cops use a choke hold on the jihads.
in at the gun owners saved the day.
i think you are missing the point.
yeah super tough gun guys protect everyone.
of course it dear. * pats you on the head *
there is a reasonable interpretation. lol
if only i were as smart as random twitter guy.
is an patriot and hero imho
you destroyed that straw man. nice job.
no one in has ever been murdered. the guns protected us every time
yes. and save us from attacks.
i i know. it is racist. diversity.
if you keep them no need to worry about hostages, right ?
you mean
you literally typed this with like four of your fingers in one nostril.
fucking a right our guns is why we have the lowest murder rate in the world !
protests will end everyone will remember how badly we need cops to prevent terrorism ?
at least you have going for you
i hope you are not really this stupid, but i think you may be
is these people part of a performance art piece where everyone is an idiot on line ?
nothing to do with strengthening law enforcement. cops do not need more bullets.
if only the kids at sandy hook had more guns
and somehow it would be blamed on either bush or global warming.
. hey who caught the boston bombers and therefore prevented them from further attacks ?
no immigration from countries. revoke all visas for those here now.
democrats and media matters would instantly stu about the as well.
some are. others are
owning a gun makes you a hero imho. 1 gun = 1 heroism
cops were very popular after that.
a hostage situation at a sydney cafe has come to an end , after police stormed the scene . live
could deaths be avoided did the australian police not overreact ?
let is go ppm wake up conceal & amp ; carry is game on
: australian police have named the suspect in the sydney siege : islamic leader sheik man haron monis
police have named the suspect in the : islamic leader shark man aaron monks via :
sheik man that is a shi'a turban there
of a racist bastard then that is not my problem
la that is what you guy telling us every time something like that happens.
sheik is going to be shot through the head soon what an asshole to attack regular citizens.
go figure. what a surprise !
monies who kidnap hostages in sydney
time to roundup his. who knows how many he has with his.
police name suspect in sydney siege : islamic leader shark man aaron monks ‚Äù
not a real self proclaimed. please correct.
why do not they just put a bullet in hie head and end it
sydney siege ongoing ; pm says unclear if politically motivated . our latest update
our prayers are with you jimmy, stay safe.
black flag with white script .... could be anyone. no reason to suspect islamic motivated terrorist.
i wonder if it is a muslim
holds hostages listen live on radio
shoot those animals with bullets marinated in pigs blood !
3 hostages have escape or been let go !
he and everyone else knows. it is well pastime pretending about these things.
tell last thing on my mind is watching last up of n'room tonight even though love show
siege ongoing pm says unclear if politically motivated. ‚Äù
australians showing us how it is done . = solidarity and no to racism towards muslim community during sydney seige
i have got nothing but respect for you.
you keep bring up judging people on their looks yet i have not once said that.
i do know that. but thanks for taking time out of your day to educate me.
its not racist to hate a religion
any race can be a muslim or islam. it is not racist to hate a religion.
you cannot narrow down clothing and color to a religion. your argument is invalid.
the truth is the sydney man holding hostages is not just putting the people in the cafe in danger but
one man ignite hatred against millions of peaceful people.
i think he is committing a crime. the utah is not. lets keep perspective
it always like that. may allah guide us with knowledge camp ; patience amen
this is sad indeed. people are really fearful now. watering holes will lose business
just went past 12 hours since this started . we are thinking of the hostages and their families at this
its heartbreaking to watch my thoughts and love being sent your way sydney.
any lone nutjob who wants international attention for a crime now just has to wave a black flag around .
really is that why u shamelessly agreed2 comparison of barbaric isis with benign sang his
to be fair that nut job is an extremist nut job.
more than half of terrorist (isis) is from the west. mosad/cia and now raw jumping in
well bro keep living in denial.
you mean like ?
these will not be lone nut jobs mate.
nus rah flag or. is it just generic ?
should not you wait to hear the facts before you make such a statement.
if i kill from pistol, will the pistol be called a killer or me ?
amp terrorists will continue to exist until zionism & amp ; wahhabi defeated.
looks like he does not know diff between ' hare ram ' & amp ; ' harm '.
should round up those foreigners like the uk authorities did to the germans living in ww2 uk
true. likewise of has made fight against terrorism much tougher because of their sheer generalization only. üò¢üò¢
lucky it is nothing to do with islam ‚Äú.
it is a serious question. she was listed in his manifesto.
i suppose it was unavoidable.
no no i mean what the uk authorities did to germans living in the uk during.
majority of victims r muslims. wonder y they r killing their own religion, low
you mean what the did with jews ? how well meaning of you
good attempt sunny to completely misrepresent what he actually said.
the primary victims of & amp ; their ilk. vile man grooming non-muslims to hate muslims
false and mischievous equivalence. whoever said hare ram to kill ??
you propagate the outfit rather than the person, this is called propaganda.
one says hare ram to kill, other says the same to save, same words moron
for likes of ppm like sunny ! see this snap shot tweet !
my prayers go out to everyone who is involved in the disaster in sydney , hope everyone will get out
thank you nick from all of us down under we thank you for the support shown !
praying for the hostages and their families. please help us prevent the backlash against innocent muslims
thank you for your love and support, it means a lot nick
hopefully they can be all saved. üôèüôèüôèüôè it is almost chrichristmas this happened so heart breakingüò≠üò≠ ...
thank god at least 5 people were able to escape !
your lovely soul is everything to meüò≠üò≠üíó
thoughts and prayers are with them ‚ù§Ô∏è
i know right such harsh shit ! hope all is well with you !
yeah it is been along wait and very scary especially living close by.
been watching it on all day from melbourne. such a crazy world ! üòü

there is no source because she is making it up.
if you must claim such statements about leaving sydney cd, link to the true article source.

australia has a long history of terrorism ( the use of violence in the pursuit of political aims ) ....
do not try to correct a wrong with a wrong
state terrorism while individual terrorism deplored.
still does not make it right, even if it is reversed.
is not history strange. so little knowledge is absorbed !
it was to provoke a discussion, not for you to be a sarcastic cock.
: gunman tall man in late 40s , dressed in black ‚Äì eyewitness
you have also forgotten to say he is a coward using somebody as a human shield.
we must be careful at this time to ascribe motives for any alleged crime
i can see him so why can not a sniper put a bullet through his head ?
gunman takes several people hostage at cafe in
because there is a bloke with a camera in the way, as usual.
because shooting him right away would prevent the government from politically exploiting the situation.
the only thing missing from his attire is a sniper bullet through his religion of peace head.
gunman tall man in late 40s, dressed in black ‚Äì eyewitness ‚Äù
take him and interview him.
gunman tall man in late 40s, dressed in black ‚Äì eyewitness ‚Äú
obviously armed who talks about jihad muslim !!!
because his advised there is 4 bombs that he can detonate if shot.
gunfire and explosions were heard at the cafe moments after a group of hostages ran from the building .
what an armhole comment to make. showing your intelligence there mate
am i the only one thinks this is all bollocks to create islamophobia and other things ?
did they kill the bastard ?
not sure. i think so
my god they have a juggernaut there, hope everyone is ok.
from inside martin place newsroom we can see gunman is rotating hostages , forcing them to stand against windows ,
holding the flag thats humiliation
... he is been trained.
one hostage has been holding up the flag up against the window for 8 hours
am prayed for help them üôè
pardon the pun but that sounds like a !
what is going on honestly heard. looks like a protest in a form of hostages.
- 1,570,000,000 muslims in the world - 500,000 muslims in australia -1 terrorist in do not stereotype
yes. extremists not every !!!!!!!!
oh so now women are not treated well here ?
prejudice linked to low :
hopefully today more and more people will realism the true threat sydney faces every day with muslim extremists
once again. extremists are minority. they are what a majority of asylum seekers flee from !
oh i am fully aware of many muslims hate extremists. does not help that all extremists are muslim
i heard they treat women extremely well in syria, you will get some attention at least.
very dangerous have a look at middle east. i bet you support haas ??
your argument is to wished washy ... you say one thing then change your mind ::
read about you will be amazed what you will find. islam is a peaceful religion
will you ride with me ?
are you also thinking of taking hostages for your islamic beliefs ? good luck
why are we calling him a terrorist ?
fuck up nobody asked your worthless terrorist loving opinion.
i do not support anyone. i support peace and leaving the innocent alone !!
yeah. i notice is trending. does not that say something douche canoe ??
oh you stupid bigot. you are embarrassing yourself.
so those who want a peaceful existence are not allowed to flee ?
everyone who has spoken to her has left the conversation feeling disgusted they came across such a cretin.
is not perfect when it comes to sexism so look in your own back yard first !
i will be completely honest with you. she makes terrorists look extremely good and ethical
blames men for sexually assaulting her. nothing to do with me
you really are not bright are ya ?
not every just the vast majority.
the police have described the operation as an anti-terror one.
yes because women are treated fantastically here idiot
i do not support terrorism ! fuck you are thick !!
typical of you people live in australia but still criticism everything. how disgusting.
think you will find i have but thanks for making assumptions üëçüëç
trend is your friend spanner.
so why do not you condemn this terrorist ??
it is not my hash tag thanks.
everyone should feel safe just like those poor hostages taken by a deranged islamist.
australians tweet to support muslims fearing an anti-islam backlash from the sydney hostage siege
maybe they could tweet something for the hostages too
thank you simply great ppm n i salute ur wisdom n courage
islam is a non-violent religion . do not let a few extremists or the media fool you .
there are and always have been christian groups involved with terror attacks. and also : spanish inquisition.
wow. that is rather egotistical.
the 1. 7 billion support the islamic caliphate incident - its one explosive pot
they are 1. 5 billion do not be part of propaganda
and stop saying loves you ‚Äú. i do not know any mexican guys.
the whimsical and very jealous biblical god is anything but about love.
the bible has something to say about people that have to announce that they will be praying ...
you should add into that list of extremists.
also you sound just like any other religious extremist. proof that you are the right one ?
with a very haughty and smug air of superiority over heathens
1. 5 billion supporting jihads
so you are against extremists forcing their religion on others ... unless it is your religion ?
do not be part of ‚Äú head in sand ‚Äú flock !

you said we went to war for saudi oil ? when ?
you have asked me to repent multiple times today, little preachy
please enlighten me oh hater of all things u.s.
brother. phi.
recognizes all people are born with inalienable god given rights our constitution protects those rights
and oil was a different war - keep up mate
stay there. we are & amp ; we are free to express our beliefs.
unlike u pitiful peasants who must grovel at feet of government americans have rights protected by our constitution
awakened to what exactly ? i do appreciate your efforts, please bare with me
she is as in that is why she sounds like a fucking idiot.
plea is what i said and meant. i am not speaking in hateful sarcasm.
censorship works in countries ... that is part of the problem.
we have never gone to war for saudi oil. period. i am not angry at all.
strong abuse mate. i can see the logic in reducing violence by increasing weapons.
. my look like tom in oz ?
are you why would we australian citizens be interested in your opinion. works for us.
your free will. i have told you the truth.
your country has a lot more violent crime than the usa, you moron
i cannot speak for foreign policy of over 20 years ago phil - my apologies
you would not be bigoted against christians would you ? you should repent while you can.
you have also invaded or occupied over 40 different countries on the last 2 decades.
i do not do drugs.
hey banned guns and violent crime skyrocketed wise up and stop giving your rights away
its probably not the most appropriate time to have a go at australian gun laws.
thank you. and thanks for follow.
as gun ownership in has grown, violent crime is down, you blithering idiot !
well that is the thing, the facts do not backup what claims
i am not preaching. i am speaking the truth. no it is up to you.
i do not watch fox.
it is not a few you blind limey propagandist.
sorry deleted last tweet your pic looked like tom in oz.
i was born from my mother.
happy to look at the evidence that supports your position. oh wait. there is not any.
i did say stay out of it - keep shooting yourselves and funding a corporate elite through the nra
anytime we have a shooting in usa you illiterate clowns lecture us !
really never hear of beheading on street ?
are you a parody account ? this can not be the rational thought of a sane human being.
you can not even answer the simple question. someday you will be wakened. i tried.
probably best to assume they are a troll and ignore. attention seeker ...
. someone does not pay attention to world need or watches 2 much mm
is called you racist. nne is called you anything.
when did we go to war for saudi oil ?
use some logic. it does not square with your accusation.
you concentrate on your own backyard
hatred and sarcasm ... interesting plea.
the killing brotherhood allay nazis. i do not watch mm ass.
kill more muzzles than all others combined in all of history moron.
that is my point you invaded another country for their oil first.
this will be good when did we go to war for saudi oil ?
my heart goes out to all involved . stay strong and be safe sydney !
thanks just an update 5 people are out !
it is stupid ..... but anyway
but why you did not tweet about ukraine ?!.....
hope everyone is staying safe in sydney
your sentiments mean a lot. thanks for thinking of them. x
thanks upsetting this is not been as is about ... dark day for all !
call it extremism . call it stupidity . but do not call it " islam " . do not slander
it‚Äôs super huh ? that‚Äôs what my muslim friends say.
it is just some stupid radicals using that verse stated in the duran to get what they want
they should have. i am not advocating that. 2 wrongs do not make a right.
i‚Äôm blessed. have a great day. gotta go.
does your school ever not taught you to never trust the internet ? -_-
what do you know about him ?
thank you for your clear sighted view in a world that prefers to hate
is principle of peace is stated over & amp ; over again like in 5.
who the wants to communicate with pervert scums like your ilk ? get lost arab rape products
why not discover more wonderful treasures about him by reading the gospels ?
is the word for someone who does not hold the same beliefs as a muslim
will catch this later. easy to have a bogeyman. hard to take time to understand. peace
i will only communicate with you if you do not stoop to gutter level name calling. thanks
and you are so ironic. calling yourself a christian man but spreading hate regarding other religions.
praise god his word clarifies the confusion of men. translation ‚Ä¶ no problem whatsoever.
do u have anything to say about this ?
no bro. i do have islamic friends, they do not advocate killing non-islamic people.
and accept that not everything written in the modern day bible is accurate
it should be about the creator, not the created to keep the order logical.
i‚Äôve heard that one before. right ‚Ä¶ no peaceful solution to conflict, huh ?
this is what the pervert cult propagates .....
but the prescribes violence more than 100 times. not a religion of peace.
oh wow that is like blaming your mom for the ignorant behavior you portray now.
i meant people who take religion seriously do these stuffs. they can even be called psychos.
any message ‚Äô from god can be translated into any language with no trouble, right ?
problem is whether know this rule of ‚Äú no punishment for speaking out ‚Äú
when bush called it a crusade, no one went up in arms about the religious angle
read a lot of it. anger. no peace.
okay my dear friend. tell me, does christian promote killing ?
just revealing truth instead of buying lies.
you are such a joke giving me links to the internet.
and on the topic of context :
i am highly critical of americans for doing that.
you can not directly translate the duran. it has different meanings as the vowels are different
i am pretty sure does not approve you in believing lies and accusation to other religions
it is just a pity the duran advocates killing non-muslims.
in short it is the people not the religion. period.
this is amp ; teachings of the pervert pedophile prophet
i just wish would teach muslims not to gang rape so many children in england.
yes. peaceful do not advocate it. but the qumran itself does.
well it is lucky the all-loving god took their side, i guess !
how can you translate something that the meaning changes from time to time.
the verse you quoted was before the very first battle they fought where they were outnumbered camp ; under-equipped
is just one of many such verses)
no one calls terrorists when they kill, rape & amp ; bomb millions ... irony.
you are one ignorant guy. the duran was written in arabic, not english, idiot
you think sharing truth is an ignorant behavior. hmmm.
anyway brother from another the quote you have quoted is incomplete. there is two sides
oh how about you ask jesus to open up your eyes and stop being a blockhead
thank you thank you thank you
his words did not change but the translation. are you dumb ?
there is no punishment for speaking out what you feel. üôè
every verse has a reason why it was revealed, so why do not you research before assuming ?
give me one thing that is beautiful about and is unique and specific to this religion ?
helping me by accusing a religion. wow
and you are telling me that islam is the only religion that is promoting non-peace
violence is everywhere. 109 times. like here with beheading.
have you been paying attention to the overall discussion ? can‚Äôt tell by your comment.
a police operation is underway in martin place , sydney is cbd . people are advised to avoid the area
all the best. a clear standoff between good and evil right now in sydney.
the people are behind all of you in these trying times !
as the continues , three faiths come together to pray for peace at lakemba mosque . photo :
blown up buildings. like lets say abortion clinics ... oh wait.
was brain not a terrorist ?
... did motivations for terrorism have to be religious ?
it could happen in if muslims just accepted israel is right to exist. simple.
i did not recall he killed all those poor people in the name of christianity ?
his actions were partially to ‚Äú preserve a christian europe ‚Äú, but since when ...
mosque is center cause of such activities ,,, why all terrorist are muslims ?
terrorist amp 2 stupid fucks are trying to dominate the world.
so proud this is exactly how the world should behave everyday respect
i am sure by your logic myra handle was a terrorist
a pleasure seeing such a photo we need to bring more people together
the occasional abortion clinics being blown up is also in the name of christianity ?
congrats on your tweet !
they did not exactly stop him, did they ?
inspiring. there must be more of this. united we stand.
that was never my argument. my argument is that not all terrorists are muslim
in the modern not all muslims are terrorists - but all terrorists are muslim.
do not only can be terrorists. christians have never ...
would not it is great if this happened in gaza also
even he still killed and injured, first hand, more people than any terrorist since 9/11
and he never cited religious, political or ideological motives. breivik did.
tell that to the parents of those kids. an act of terror is an act of terror
like the effort do not like the smile and the photo op
everybody is allowed to eat chicken, and nobody likes scientologists. let is build from there.
anyone willing to kill others over politics/religion has to have something wrong with them
sadly , this needs to be pointed out with the amount of islamophobia that is currently being posted .
it is not if it is true you moron.
0 to none trust me we all hate them, they ruined the middle east for fuck sake
guns really do not seem to be an actual deterrent to murder
obviously not ship who use green flags, not black.
you wanna get email notification every time they of, go read a book or something
and beheading is for those who deserve it (such as murderers)
even this group is a minority
good me also pray for people killed by muslim hitler oh wait ....
yawn ... still absolutely tiny compared to the worldwide total muslim population. nice try though.
the truth will set you free
no.
. the point is not the number, but how islamic culture keeps producing them.
nobody condemned crimes as terrorism : western media went overboard to hide muslim identity of perks.
. the point is not the number, but how islamic culture keeps producing them.
what percentage are sympathetic to those two groups ?
what amp ; their supporters like album chaudhry ?
any crime done by is condemned terrorism even if did not have a religious motive
they why do not they do something about it ????? curious why you are not pointing that out
so everyone who supports sharia law is terrorist ? do you even know what is sharia ?
sadly we helped create head & amp ; taliban to fight soviets
the only major terrorist attacks in australia in the past 30 years were perpetrated by christians.
also it was more of an ethnic group than a religious one.
or is for that matter ?
1400 in alone doubt that.
describes an honor killing. refer within source :
i will note the attached washington post graphic as superior.
honor killing is not in sharia law
why is not listed in that chart ?
caught meaning of sharia ' unclear. most favor democracy, oppose violence.
let is agree to disagree if you believe that their support of sharia ends at their border.
it tells me shockingly large number of people want to impose the law of the duran on me.
they all together count for about 100k or less ...
counting all crimes across the globe, muslims will probably make 1% of that
the article you pulled your stats from does, though. have you read it ?
most of these are not existence in arab muslim countries and slavery is not a thing in muslim culture
you would think that would be a deterrent.
the 1400 girl abuses you know most of these were muslim girls ? and the rapists were asian
maybe because that would be the most inaccurate construction of information ever ah aha
you sound about as as jihadists are is what happens when ppm stray from true teachings.
and just like the no thanks. not debating the interpretation of either.
your ignorance is your racism is undeniable, and your logic is fucking laughable.
my thoughts are with the people in sydney right now
what is going on in sydney ?
i am going there for 3 weeks tomorrow i am really scared now
like i honestly thought this bs died months ago last time i was in sydney (september)
people are being held hostage at a cafe.
i love you more than pizza. but shah do not tell pizza !
stop saying we only care about the sydney siege because it is 5sos ' home . we care because it
from and i definitely agree with this.
congrats on your tweet !
what the hell how rude can people get. honestly.
you only look like a fuck wit when you make up stories relating to the - unless you read it
this is what everyone should do- spread the word !!
all this false information is only making people more anxious.
all the stuff on channel 7 rn is true right ?
the people nearby tweeting information on police movement need to realism that this is counterproductive
you tell them small. i like that you corrected your own station
such a terrible thing should not be messed with
this guy on win is trying to scare everyone üòí
australian police and media denying the sydney gunman precisely what he wants : free publicity . very controlled coverage .
whereas grandstanding about it doesn‚Äôt count of course
can not claim to be an expert but fr what i have seen, pols very much like us/uk
it must be they are handling this wisely.
incredibly impressive so far
us would not have gentleness of concern for well being all, and would be shouting shoving public
interested you think that. maybe in this case but as media more like us normally.
tone of coverage is far superior to what we tend to see in uk and us
have you seen them campaign ? locals are concerned re backlash.
more regular having very touching reaction
it is a truly inspired idea.
hope admirable certain meticulous precision as method will provide the results of deescalated site, calm walkout
apart from rolling footage of the whole thing, including the sahara flag in the window.
. do you think it would be different in the us/uk ?
media somewhat less dramatic and people much less likely to grab pitchforks
nuclear immense constrained energy fear provoking, death suggestive, evocative equal deadly force
albeit there are rotten eggs.
i thought the topic was related to the lack of information released about the gunman and his demands
i suspect the it would be restrained. i can not comment on the us.
no matter how much you try to bring us down , one thing about australian is is we always stand
i want to live in australia just so i can say strata
so fucking true. we are a pack of fucking rats and booze drinking dumb cunts.
mates will always stick together. thanks for sharing mate

the muslamic council have called an emergency meeting to ensure that muslims & amp ; islam are seen as the
oh dear she seems rather aggressive, that is unusual from a follower of the religion of peace '
if it was than tell me about the other billion who is not driven to extremism.
it is feeling like that. still do not know how many hostages there are.
shut the fuck up you ignorant cunt
did not read his flag did you. put your emotions aside and be realistic.
not all a threat but there is something in islam that drives millions to extremism.
and i hope they continue doing that
i and imagine the outrage from the lefties
and the rest of the ‚Äú peaceful ‚Äú community are out on twitter screaming they are victims of racism
they would all be dying their hair blue and trying to look like albert step toe ?
i keep hearing this but it is still muslims that are joining isis and acting on there behalf.
another condemnation statement lets c a mass demonstration by all muslims on the streets denouncing isis !!!!
almost call her an extremist.
the victims are the people being held hostage - talk about trying to exploit the situation to their advantage
its so funny how they all came out of their hole, they got what they want
i said the same thing to a ‚Äú moderate ‚Äú muslim today. will not bloody happen.
yes i watched qt too low
there may not be mass demonstrations but believe me you will have trouble finding muslims that support isis
just read a you would think it was a white guy holding 6 muslims hostages
already in play. obviously has as many useful idiots as uk
no point wasting time with people like this
they want to eat it & amp ; have it too ai not they ?
it is just another member of the pack.
thats funny because yesterday there were hundreds of muslims wouldenouncing isis ' in a march in london ydayüòÇ
if it had been a skinhead holding up a nazi flag .... he would be dead by now
are these the same billion that endorse death for apostasy ???

disgraceful that some people just took series, gawped, jeered or swilled beer at hostage scene.
if u abuse or target a innocent muslim man or woman in response to what is happening in sydney you
and the home secretary can strip him of citizenship.
i would like to see some of these racist tweets. you have them ?
we need leaders with balls first !!
you only have to it, to see the racist things he has posted
that is not even worthy of a response you have been brainwashed too low !!!
i am not defending any group who uses violence as a means to portray it is point.
agree with that statement !
no explanation just cliches and rhetoric from you then ?
way pastime him and supporters were deported.
look i agree but we are no better if we went around ripping scarves of mosley women
you not half talking some crap mate ... literally reaching for any connection, pathetic !
he started the eds then turned his back on them !! got an answer love ??
his eds was hijacked by supremacists/racists w diff agendas, so he disassociated himself. simple.
i was lucky i could scrutinize :
you believe his bullshit you deserve what you get !!
have done a great service to the ppm of the uk
no i am just not a cunt. scaring muslim women solves what exactly
do not be so naive !! spare us please !!!!!
and series in bed ? saggy old skin, try working out.
by sleeping with the enemy ??? lol
by pointing out truths and facts, burying our heads in the sand will solve fuck all
give an they size two miles by force. there is no compromise.
needs to be proscribed and exterminated in this country.
you should be reported for racism
1 against 2 i asked if it was the same speech where he handed to someone
so why have arrests dropped since the left. sounds like he is a negative influence
big mouth sue low big as your ass with no class !!!!
there are only three types of mosley.
for example the salutes hal hitler chants at your rallies
you are a fucking lisa. what exactly does targeting innocent people solve ? üò∂
there is not a cowardly bone in your body
but we could exile him. like napoleon.
and criminals sent to oz.
not arguing stating a fact .... m8
i have not seen her comments or views so ?
you love are the type of cunt that gave the eds shit like being racists
exactly right we do not lower our selves to extremism or we become what we are fighting against
fact cholera wants us to live under sharia law.
and the rest of the uhf is sordid sexual activities regarding female treatment ?
the maggot was born here.
turned into a monster. these things happen. so he moved on. extremely brave.
well done a bit of honesty !!!!
who created would disagree i would imagine.
anyone doing those activities at an eds demo is ejected ! anymore tired cliches ?
there are no moderate that moderate ' has to be used shows that.
you block get the fuck off my time line & lt ;
arrests have dropped due to efforts of both police liaison and our own stewards ...
considering you state you are anti islam, i do not expect you to agree or be objective
when i lead eds after lee rights killing i said the same. check my newcastle speech
sorry mate but you are and you are a traitor to your own people and a seething coward ....
that is so lame low !!
what does my opinion on islam have to do with tommy is alleged racism ?
hey that is an idea !!
fight evil with calm measured decency. rage & amp ; anger has accomplished what ? lives in ashes
i totally agree with you mate i am with you !!!!
they need to be removed and islam proscribed like it is in japan.
i expelled the elizabeth i
you share the same views and opinions belong to the same group.
it might be ... but what does that have to do with what he said himself ?
thanks for that x
kicking people out who are not wanted ? i do not think
he rants. like that cannibal.
too ignorant to argue with ... arguing with a fool only proves there is 2 low !!!!
so does is she racist too ?
i do not remember tommy ever stirring up hate. message was always inclusive
the hostages are what matters attacks on women wearing headscarves would be cowardice and pathetic
i am hoping for the day we execute the men and deport the woman children
was that the same speech where you gave the microphone to a bloke who made racist comments
boo fucking are not the victims. the hostages are the victims.
you cannot compromise with a cult that demands u convert or die. how is that negotiable
the thugs will be on the side of the jihads.
how is he sleeping with the enemy
no they are there is no such thing as a moderate, innocent mosley.
why surround your self in those believes if they are not your own.
and by pardon i what the fuck are you on about ?
to perfect. then cancel his passport.
whilst we let the imams indoctrinate the foot soldiers of the future.
very well said by the way
however ... plenty of so called peaceful uhf/anti fa arrests at counter demos tho ...
so your entire point is ... someone (not tommy) said something so that makes him racist ?
at least not everyone are sheep !!
i do not think we should attack the muslims. we should stop islamic immigration.
video released of hostage
because he promotes racism and hate
this experiment could be ok or we could end up with several cities like belfast
you are too daft to even argue with m8 low
yeah totally agree. how can any intelligent person think otherwise ?
who was making racist which reinforces my point.
i will forever be grateful to the & amp ; & amp ;

good one long time and guess brussels is good ...
judge. calling random people out will not make your opinion look better.
if you have any lingering doubts that the threat of radical islam is global as well as lethal ... via
world shows how fucked your worldview is, designating territory due to religion. how liberal
really a little presumptive is not it ?
i certainly have no lingering doubts that lazy islamophobia is likely to kill more people.
definitely not lands ' if we are wanting to make progress.
is every white academic a racist ?
so what would you call the area from pakistan to turkey to morocco ?
i would never realized you were a sam harris-style islamophobe ! disgusting and disappointing. unfollowing now.
but practically all modern terrorists are muslim. statistics, ya know.
you are correct
so the minority religions do not get representation because you can not think of a better name ?
is simply another name for someone who actually understands it
is tweeted because it distracted from the actual issue of jihad threat and implied moral ...
time to impose immigration barriers.
then you are too dumb to deal with bye
well it is true. the us backed adam and helped him fight the iranians.
not when the track history of us intervention suggests that it will probably make things worse.
cue multiple western cringing clueless pols saying ‚Äú nothing to do with islam ‚Äú
give me a break. most us foreign aid is spent by dictators on tools of oppression
you mean the regime that the us helped put in place ?
do you mean western imperialism as manifested in ukraine and syria, vladimir vladimirovich ?
really so all those troops in the muslim world are just a part of my imagination ?
by this all psychologists are torturers ? or all christians are terrorists ?
... critique us foreign policy.
presence does not equal which was your original accusation. explain the threat.
given that western imperialism disappeared some 60 years ago.
i guess we will end this on a point of agreement then.
... have to include all the humanitarian aid and efforts to help establish self determination.
i would say 500,000 dead iraqi children during the 1990 is sanctions qualifies as a disaster.
a nice way to hahn. have a good one.
is it now by the way you still have not explained this no threat '.
no chocolate shop is safe from the anti-chocolate spread of islam.
it is also clear you have no idea what imperialism is.
no need to wait for the facts all ?
to generalize any religion based on, out of context statistics is wrong.
with that logic then explain all non muslims are what ?
do not move the your initial tweet was about the ‚Äú threat ‚Äú of western imperialism.
the us is still paying assisi to violently put down protests.
is the devil is tool all muslims are spiritually deceived and many kills for that deception
means peace. love for all, hatred for none.
it is. just like white supremacy.
how does it compare to the threat of western imperialism ?
so having hundreds of military bases in 100+ countries and propping up dictators is not empire ?
this is so gross ( via )
how is it different to millions watching it on the evening news ?
they should be gawking on twitter and tv like the rest of us ...
talk at the traumatic terrorist attack
does not look like fears her in sydney
it is different. onlookers are contributing to congestion. its not helping.
rt this is so gross (via) ‚Äù
i am thinking some could well be close relatives etc
so a hundred viewers on site of incident is worse than millions of tv viewers glued to networks ?
staying away so police do not have to also do crowd gmt ?
issues that we have 2face dadadaistations pppalsrtraumatizings everyday
what is wrong with people ?
how do you know they are not related to the hostages or something ?
they all should be moved on ! why would you put yourself in danger !
go home you fools you are not helping !
so morbid and disrespectful. also quite dangerous.
yeah i get that. but the public ? people please ! really ?
ridiculous. media i the rest need to fuck off.

such powerful images of hostages escaping , those poor women . and the fear for those still trapped inside
do not post images of the police on scene !!!
just fyi , if you are using a hostage situation to justify your racism and islamophobia you are using the
if anyone is doing that to take advantage of the hostage situation then they deserve our condemnation
only if you are equating muslims with islamist. most people know the difference.
unfortunately this has made all people of islamic faith a target.
that is how i treat born again christians who are filled with so much hate.
see if you still believe that if they blow the cafe up mate
was created by air a terrorist organization
polls show of muslims support jihad .... let that sink in.
this is so right. innocent people are always that !

let is hope the hostages are the best thing to come out the
come back and told me iraqis are the nicest people they have ever met.
as has most religions. worshiping sky pixies and many of these problems will vanish.

wait so because bombs go off in iraq and pakistan you think they are bad people ?
thanks but no seen enough to already have idea they have my sympathy but in used to freedom

what has that got to do with anything ? you have lost me, mate !
and you know what happens to enemies of islam
cheers mate are you in canada ? i always adore your country üòä
they construe the meaning and extract out of context. and ppm are so gullible these days.
why would you ban a religion for ‚Äú not ‚Äú killing women or children
you do realize ‚Äú is the generally accepted term for a universal god right ? no ownership
i will read it and get back to you
we should not condemn on what the christens did in south africa
have you read the entire duran ? i have not so will not judge all by a few
if you kill a life unjustly it is as if you have killed the whole of humanity.
stay strong and know a few do not judge all by 1 man is actions
i think it is due to the fact that it is the dominant religion in a politically unsettled region
i believe that everybody has the right to defend themselves so the war passage do not offend me
cheers and have a goon night and stay safe world is crazy
which is fair probably they have never read it
i have been to and toronto. canadians are the kindest people on earth !!!!
read this and get some perspective
are there peace loving muslims ? yes, a thousand times yes !
i am sure innocent ‚Äú has a totally different meaning in islam. what do you think ?
unfortunately this is where twitter is at it is best and worst . please do not tweet about with police
social media until situation is resolved by police/trained authorities. too much speculation/rumors may jeopardize it.

the pattern is to complex for lefties. lol
and literally 25 thousand or so other islam-related terrorist attacks since 9/11/01.
that ' ' must be easier to misunderstand than we think.
if only there were a common thread between all these incidents ...
ft hood and make the list as well
let us not forget ok.
these workplace violence incidents are getting out of hand.
i am fairly certain your pattern would be profiling ... use of common sense is frowned upon.
died in isolated incidents last month.
do not forget .... oh crud, sorry, that been workplace violence.
do not forget 1,600 women raped in england and not a peep.

because it seems that some people here need this clarification
i so sorry to hear that about your country.
because it seems that some people here need this clarification ‚Äù basically
you are so try again.
indeed. however extremists of any persuasion can create havoc disproportionate to their numbers.
its less a religious problem than one of education. extremists are born from poverty and illiteracy
power and that is why. its easy with that degree to convince uneducated men to follow
so be the teacher of your wrong students, and stop complaining about the rest of the world
with all due you seem to have forgotten a few more groups ....
because it seems that some people here need this clarification ‚Äù
the peaceful majority is irrelevant (i.e. they are not the problem)
huh i know its hard to express yourself in 140 characters, but ?
update : the australian grand mufti has strongly condemned the actions of the lone gunman in .
you have some problems with facts ? hate is not mine.
and you what a follower of jesus looks like ?
and no times were committed by followers of jesus. oh, wait a minute.
our prayers are with those who are held as hostage. this incident is so disturbing ...
if i was able to change anything trust me i would walk into the cafe with no fear.
you should better watch the world :
you deserve a little violence to the head. cockhead.
i believe you. bigots complain when not enough condemnation and still complain when there is.
you are creating violence with your ignorance and hate.
where are should be in martin place talking to this coward
so media is your reference ... you sound uneducated so ill let you be ...
go away annoying fat fly.
just makes me cry. especially seeing the hate come out.
i could find 206 parts with instruction to violence from believers against unbelievers.
gives bad on both sides a chance to hate !!!!
how do you know they are not ? i have heard at least an offer has been made.
attack i only like the truth. you know the duran ?
i say fuck off to you.
the true problem you can find in the difference of doctrine. in duran violence is inherent.

they would not be hostages in the first place. we have guns.
but it happens all the time in the movies !
bloodbath. but it would have been over in an instant
not all are gun-toting lunatics. title is offensive.
what complete and utter fuck wits mate.
the amount that defend themselves with a gun each year outlays murders
utterly depressing is not it ?
30,000 people a year kill themselves in japan ... without guns.
this is hand guns were extremely uncommon in uk and still are not common.
sadly some people really believe that.
ugh. rt readers weigh in with their messages of support.
you are offended let me fix that for you
what is the pop of sydney ?
is there any example of someone with concealed weapon stopping a shooting ? why quote those bozos ?
at least more a giving the thumbs down than thumbs up to those drooling shoot'n'gigglers.
i will read it shortly lunch is over
exactly. gun solve they just make things more bloody.
exactly. i tweeted a very similar thing earlier today.
even with possessing an you would not feel safe.
rt readers weigh in with their messages of support.
now is not the time for dude.
this is not about you. they are calling out shitty actions of some of your fellow countrymen.
they were daily mail readers so pretty much to be expected. üòï
actually that is incorrect. many suicides are impulsive and opportunity related, especially in men
too many illegally owned now for any more than limits on how many per person.
uncommon were talking about legality are we not ? banning them made no difference.
the gun thing in the usa is so fucked up. üò•
thanks offs : : american readers weigh in with their messages of support. ‚Äù
to show how effective ‚Äú the ban has been only shows that there are other factors involved
i found country but not by city
and that makes it better ?? not to mention the fact that having guns around may increase suicide rates
why would you bring a gun with you to a chocolate shop anyways ?!?!?!??!
covered here ' what john howard could teach us about gun control '
i love the tweets about the support the aussie muslims are getting. good on you all !
so is a quick resolution with many casualties preferable to a lengthy siege with no bloodshed ?
speechless. the stupidity.
any excuse to get all tingly about their guns.
us unintentional fatalities firearms 591 ‚Äú does not include the 10,000 plus deliberate shootings then ?
id be glad to provide more information and sources later after work ... lunch break is short
cos ' carrying guns has always prevented sieges and deaths in us has not it.
the idea that more guns results in fewer gun deaths is without any doubt an extraordinary claim.
or mass oh wait that already happens in america.
cos guns save lives. said no one ever
it always seems dumb and loud are synonymous.
hey the horrible hostage situation is not an opportunistic time to argue about your gun laws
the best tweet i have read so far.
as in daily fail no wonder ...
readers weigh in with their messages of support. ‚Äù wow.
apologies i could only find a screen spotted one off this ...
were the victims off this attack not daily citizens buying $4 coffee ?
not going to pursue this but suggest you consider : extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence
i do feel safe here in the us ....... i wonder if that is because of amendment
readers weigh in with their messages of support. ‚Äù & lt ; sigh

how does the world battle terrorism when the very ideology behind it is exempt from criticism .
how do you feel about the tweet i am replying to now that we know about the gunman ?
they have very strong 90% of terror strikes are carried out by radical islamist.
so killing in the name of allah prescribed in the book is a mental illness. ok
wants to send you 1 safe passage (5,719 bits/$2. 00) collect
i suppose you felt the same way about criticizing christianity in response to abortion clinic bombings ?
gee how about newspapers ??
let is see an article then.
so do not be one then. you are an apologist for misplaced hatred.
i think we have to start asking ourselves why we are so fearful of criticism.
completely them ... the lord your god has commanded you. ‚Äú
nowadays terrorism is synonymous with islam
they were localizes terror but islamic verses of duran is an ideological global terror nurturing tool.
that reply means and you know it. do better.
what do you people think the word ‚Äú apologist ‚Äú means ?
lasers ... we will battle it with lasers.
could you elaborate on that please ? your talk about 13th century crusaders was not entirely clear.
perhaps you forget that muslims and their suicide bombings of israeli civilians ?
no. please answer my question.
well i principally do not indulge apologists
what is your source for that 90% mate ?
are you having trouble understanding my question ?
murderous thieving sadistic settlers ‚Äú kill kids. may they meet their just desserts.
. it is like we are digging our own graves.
do it because of muhammad is teachings and example. so your comparison is nonsense.
perfect answer ... the terror ideology has one source mostly ‚Ä¶
take your left liberal bullshit out of my tl. get lost now.
here is to the hostages getting safe passage on this day
did i mention guilty conscience ?
are you talking of bombing palestinian civilians with white phosphorus ?
do you believe that the word ‚Äú terrorism ‚Äú means ‚Äú islam ‚Äú ?
u are having trouble relating to reality ...
thousands tweet declaring their solidarity with muslims ..
till you have more episodes like this ! you will not survive to say
they never ride with those who are the victim of islamic terror
reality is godhead attack of burning women + children alive was islamic terror
remember express and incidents of recent history ????

did somebody forget to tell that radical islamist that guns are banned in australia ?!?! .
so if shooting him triggers the alleged explosives, 100s could die
just looking out. will go nuts
i work near there ... unfortunately we are not allowed to be armed at work
latest update in :
assuming what that he has bombs ? he said it why would you think otherwise
my tweet was not directed at you
i would not. but shooting someone over what he says is foolish. shooting them because ...
they are not banned in australia, they do have strict rules though.
the effect is the same : gun free zones everywhere.
saying something does not make it so. a visibly armed hostage taker is so.
well a number of people disagree. thanks for your opinion but i am not interested.
sorry how do you know he does not have explosives ?
or we can say let is talk to them and work this out ... everyone will be safe ....
did somebody forget to tell that radical islamist that guns are banned in australia ?!?! . ‚Äù
if that sad event happened another 15x the death toll from gun violence would be an average usa day
same here. glad i am armed !
would you put your hand up to shoot someone with rumored bombs ? what a hero
you make that up ?!? * scribbles note *
i stole it off of a bumper sticker i saw on a pickup truck
which is a really good thing.
terrorists always attack where there is a no gun zone !
... they are visibly armed and have taken hostages is not foolish. it is responsible.
terrorists have been holding hostages in sydney cafe in australia, ink if caught yet.
sigh ... i give up. and i am glad i live in america
the places where there is gun violence are all places where gun laws are strictest. always.
being 4 miles from those locations, i am glad i have my arms just in case.
for all intents amp ; purposes they are banned, the restrictions are so tight.
i will leave you with this : a) dead man switch) pump shotgun mutually exclusive.
keep telling yourself that as the jihads ' attacks increase.
you are so guns are not banned here
considering that lizards start from ‚Äú nuts ‚Äú, it is a short trip
and they are dropping as firearms ownership - and carrying - are growing by leaps and bounds.
i realism that i compete & amp ; am a ssa member here
not disagreeing at all. just fundamentally not ‚Äú banned ‚Äú.
aussie muslim mullah on brings up ' australia is foreign policy ' in discussion over . shame for indulging him
promoting the narrative. again.
hope these supporters try this nonsense in china ... they will be straight sent to haven
let us see what will discuss when such a situation happens in britain, which seems very likely.
it is time for the world to unite and destroy these devils ... enough is enough
whether is also terrorist sympathizer/supporter ?

' is a foreign concept to the bbc, sadly.
always an excuse for muslims play victim and others ' foreign policy their excuse for terror.
this is not the first time nor the last for to divert attention
i guess when police told the media not to name the gunman they actually meant " please put his name
i need to find a cafe !
rt nine news says senior police gave them the go-ahead to name suspect in
is not the 1st language of the mm it is cannibalism.
reporting it is still in place
they decided it was ok now.
posted this already mate
i believe police have given the go ahead and that is why he is been named.
media did well to hold out 6 hours ... low
i right what the hell ?
no need to be sorry mate !
it is all about selling news, no matter the potential cost to lives
posted an update. interesting move by police
just in : u.s. consulate near the scene in sydney has accounted for all of its personnel :

he converted to last december. regardless, he was obviously mentally unwell
he is not a ship. he disowned being one publicly having embraced the other sect.
nuts. u r nuts. evil islam is evil.
reports said he had converted to sunni islam ? not sure of the difference
and when they realism he renounced shi'ism, they will flip again.
last heard he was demanding an isis flag.
hope his death was painful. he deserves nothing less
no more chances for the dude. he is dead.

a muslim , a jew & amp ; a christian walk into a bar . except it is an interfaith
i duly note your duly noted. duly. & gt ; & lt ;
what do you make of all this ? curious.
interfaith leaders will have also spoken about perspective. they have before, and will again.
and bigotry is not derived from religion (love thy neighbor) but weak brainwashed minds via cults
our challenges arise from many sources. as do solutions.
i do not see any booze tho
no. better beware the predetermined nonthinking ' of ideologues.
because it is violence sandra.
these staged pictures may look promising but in fact do absolutely nothing to address basic problem.
well done you come across as neither dumb nor smug in this exchange. thanks for sharing
yes but you have not addressed my challenge to thinking.
and myself made of sterner stuff.
tell that ' all things pass ' - to those hostages today.
yes. 1 gunman. with i imagine muslim officers among res ponders. thus perspective.
sadness. but was also in britain during ira offensives. all things pass.
and your distaste for interfaith unity is duly noted.
excellent. beware the peril of the short form.
your challenge is a challenge to your own thinking yet you fail to see it.
you seriously think i doubt their sincerity ? i applaud their service & amp ; cause.
. you can think of a quote that specifies that ? i am all ears.
a bar or a cafe ?
incorrect. religious leaders gathered to denounce actual violence against actual victims. not imagined bigotry
they also spoke about unless i misread reports. do you doubt their sincerity ?

much stronger than stupid sensations murdoch headlines.
ironically it seems everything did change - for the better
i suspect they were not thinking of the change that is being wrought in australia by about now !
i think shirt fronting other countries resulted in us being terror targets.
obfuscated ... quite normal for mm to do that to people ...
cognitive dissonance news corp + abbott govt
everything did change for the better explicitly yes. but skeptical ...
yes biased trying to cast itself as righteous. aussies displaying true humanity !

seriously this guy someone just can not call him a name and make him cry ?

that is not clear yet. it is known however that he just converted this month ...
police records murderers often do who killed reba karate morrison where is your record ?
nothing but antisemitic jihad supporting cunts
shoot the bastard in the balls and send him back to where he came from.
you only convert to become radical sunnis. shiite, apparently more pragmatic, do not endorse jihad.
with flag does not make any sense

my point is out of everyone that has posted to this you have been the only cunt here
... not be linked to isis. even major media are jumping to conclusions
it is on almost every tv channel in australia
that was going to be my comment on this one ... some blatant sensationalism in the mainstream media ...
fantastic and then i read the comments ...
thanks as usual is only reporting facts. other channels full of speculation
saying every muslim is a terrorist is like saying every christian is a member of the klu klux klan .
i am just pointing out the fact that sometimes religion can cause people to do horrible things.
you are doing nothing but spreading hate go get a cup of tea and take a break
obviously because anybody who chooses to kill is going against their religion no matter what they think.

hi my lady visit my country usa and seeding believe the media
but people still believe that we are all bad !! and terrorist ! although fcc are fighting them
rot in hell you evil bugger.
then it is possible this was not a terrorist plot but some supposed murderer that went bongo.
its like saying that all white christians are exactly same as kkk
yes you make peace with zionist but will never make peace with followers of ahlulbayt.

do not make me to regret what he said about the ships.
yeah tell that to your khomeini then
sorry to bother but first being an arab does not mean being a muslim
so what is the difference with you and isis ? both have the same ideology of taker.
what about those in call themselves sunnis and kill people
amp second generalizing all arabs with some fanatics that are completely stupid
you who understand should cover up honey, it is cold outside.

we we also rally against racism.
people call antisemitic why not islamophobes
if islam is a religion of peace why are not their extremist extremely peaceful ?
every such incident only establishes the fact that islam is not a religion
because every religion has people who misunderstand their religion.
because religion and peace are mutually exclusive concepts
which religions extremists are peaceful ?
i honestly love the fact that there are americans and ppm like u i am general.

you would have to be psychotic to begin with to believe there is an invisible man in the sky
you mean like the gangs in africa killing muslims & amp ; inquisition ?

the problem is that then the kkk is a good representative of christianity but not of all christians

prayers for everyone and stay safe oak
map location in is cd, and surrounding prominent buildings
because there is only one hostage taker, he will need to sleep, eventually.
i pine for of the 50 is and 60 is.
also pretty sure has not been in that position since they moved to darling quarter in 2011.
rt a map of the location at martin place in sydney is cd
excuse me morning herald your maps wrong george street should be pitt
your map labels st as george st.
rt rt rt : because it seems that some people here need this clarification
no it does not. some muslims just need education.
reformation is else what you will get is isis and you can not argue with such people
. i did back up my claims, unlike you. your duran unequivocally commands you to kill.
for examples has violent verses but most do not take them seriously or in context
hell a extremist just opened fire on a bunch of buildings in austin, tx last week
may peace be upon you.
there are nut cases in any religion, and they should conform to today civil society values
sometimes from a normal family a terrorist can happen. just saying.
just do not suggest that normal muslims have anything to do w the idiots who hurt people.
pure spin. are all these islamic countries wrong & amp ; you are right ?
obtaining the truth from these sorts of governments is like obtaining the truth from you.
they stopped because the government stopped them. go look at the goats of countries w radicals
and the statistics on how many countries actually execute people for those crimes ? saudi and iran
not a single ounce which duran are you reading ?
by that why does the kkk and neo-nazis exist ? must be white sympathy.
if you can not back up your claims, then stop making them
and why do not try to stop the kkk ?
what scholars are you talking about ? the mainstream ones teach peace and peace only
that is false analogy. many religions have violent verses, the key is how seriously ppm take them
adding to they do not represent a single ounce of what our religion is all about.
keep telling yourself that while us christian missionaries push ‚Äú kill the gays ‚Äú bills overseas
we have many types of idiot extremists here in the states.
i do not think you made the point you think you did
waiting for the 157 million to do something. their silence is deafening
go and do your research. i could post an endless list of famous religious hate preachers
people after all are free to believe what they want to believe. the problem is the actions.
the problem is the ideology which does have basis in islamic jurisprudence. islam needs reformation.
i read with contextual explanation, - ‚Ä¶ :
they exist. but they are not mainstream and mosques do not preach hate
you are completely unaware of the magnitude of the problem in the muslim world then.
i think your terrorist mate in sydney did not get the peace & amp ; love memo.
the and are based in white supremacy. white supremacy needs reformation.
do not hate just want my family safe like you do too !
if you are not aware of the situation, that is part of the problem
the no longer lynches people because christians stopped them. why do not muslims stop terrorists ?
not mentioned are book harm, isis & amp ; many others.
the potential is there given the hate scholars who are everywhere and are using social media.
the key thing is that religious beliefs should be kept private. taking them out is the problem
i do not think you made the point you think you did.

more than 40 australian muslim groups have jointly condemned the
wish they would do the same in uk when islamist attack/take hostages/behead/kill/rape, generally silence from the muslims.
you need to blame the minority and their twisted interpretation.
i i know but few and far between.
groups lie like this after attackskoran teaches lying 2 non-muslim
elephants have two sorts of teeth
ironic that majority victims of these terrorists r actually muslims i.e. iraq. check mob

i was briefed overnight on the siege in sydney . it is deeply concerning and my thoughts are with all
prime minister says he was briefed on the ongoing situation in sydney.
. nobody voted for this. & gt ; selling off hhs for profit ' nhl
cheers have a good day.
they are radicals because of a narrative not because they were born so
not as disturbing as having jimmy sale ran around for 50 years buggering children with impunity
have not they got enough to worry about without a showroom dummy like you weighing in ?
a meaningful and useful prime minister.
nobody seriously wants to be part of a siege except the mentally insane.
likewise. not a fan but i doubt the claim. need to evidence a claim such as that
how about stopping immigration to the uk by muslims from any country ? actions speak louder than words.
they do not think what they are doing is evil, they think they are making allah happy.
police have it under control. proves they learned a lot from scotland yard.
that is presuming that said radical thinkers would care for a narrative other than their own.
nothing to do with again ?
were you woken from your slumber ?
there is a way to negate it.
because we will be showing them from within their own sacred sources that those acts are evil
i hate too but mate that is a bit harsh. ouch

these self people are obviously hostages to their smart phones.
what kind of moron takes a smiling at a place like that ?
bunch of inconsiderate morons how about they negotiate that you swap places with them inside ?
how to put this nicely ........... nope not possible ..........
these self people not just lack of sympathy but also common sense.
they seem to be enjoying it
rt why a hostage situation is neither the time nor place for series ‚Äù
now i have sent it all ‚Ä¶ father has brought his two young girls to pose and take pictures at
just horrible father brought his 2 young girls to pose and take pictures at hostage scene ‚Äù
he should be arrested for his choice of clothing.
it is difficult to understand hogans at the best of times
seriously new adjectives need to be invented to describe the kind of person he is.
people never fail to bewilder me
what is wrong with people ?
i can not begin to imagine what he was thinking. if he was at all.
there were several families with children watching on as we walked back to our hotel earlier.
unfortunately now a spectator sport stop feeding their need for attention
wow. these people are incredible.
with orange shoes and floor clothes ? the levels of offense are off the charts right now.
you have had a long day
this man carries a gun , not a religion
spot on rt this man carries a gun, not a religion ‚Äù
. exactly he is carrying a gun to follow a 6th century saudi arabian desert religion
this man carries a gun, not a religion ‚Äù
this man carries a gun, not a religion !! & amp ; that flag is ????
then what was that stuff about ‚Äú god ‚Äú on his flag about then ?
and that headband reads merry xmas '
gun for fun what is that banner ?
this man carries a gun, not a religion ‚Äù
oh the twists and turns of the pious
congrats on your tweet !
he carries a black flag bearing the sahara
congrats on your tweet !
pretty sure he was also carrying a religious flag ...
. please check he is also carrying a flag
just seems to keep happening though ......
a solitary lunatic , with a history of trauma , sexual violence and a shotgun . not a jihad ,
the gen category of sexual violence, yes. fraud - they would throw the book away
that was my first thought but i did appreciate the analogy any way
these racist white people make me sick - white minority getting closer low
in this case all his victims were women.
one guy that is a birthday party one attended. heaven is gate had members.
no that is the dictionary definition of a death cult !!!
or perhaps sexual violence against women not seen as important ?
if they had been bail refused ?
yes just your common criminal who maybe should not have been given bail.
if only the system had these resources.
sorry forgot to add to my post.
perhaps if he had been alleged to have raped over 40 men instead ? no bail ?
and a judicial system that let him out in bail !
if terrorism thrives on publicity , then the media has mostly played to script writes :
they are getting what they want by creating fear and uncertainty in community via social media normal media
twitter has certainly done its share to keep stories mainstream
those news channels & amp ; anchors who did not cover assam riots citing notyranny of distance ' , are
okay. so according to some friends ... international incidents deserve more coverage than assam ... accra hie ...
level if journalism is very high. lol
riots were not an international threat. this is so there is your answer buddy
begged and borrowed from and others.
there should be far baa psi in pakistan as well.
it is the facilities they r used to
it is called physical and psychological distance from a newsworthy event. media 101.
terrorist packed everything except the most important. indian media before his act.
sad that we crave for such lopsided entertainment when white skin is involved
first page of carries thorough investigative reports & amp ; sm informative piece of news from around d world
good going toilet paper of india (to)
tonight pray for the hostages and their families in and pray too for the police on whose courage and wisdom
we must unite and forgive each other
how the hell do we forgive armholes who hold babies hostage, not while i am breathing.
talking forgiving turn bull. for us to unite and fight terrorism !
dozens of heavily armed police have surrounded the cafe in sydney is martin place .
stop. tweeting. photos. of. police.
hey maybe do not broadcast this to the guy inside the building with the gun
dozens of heavily armed police have surrounded cafe in martin place.
what good does it do to broadcast images like this ?
or the footage currently being screened ?!
your viewers do not want to see these pictures when the hostage takers can also !
what part of not posting photos of police did not you understand ?...
it is reported in media that one of the hostage is a korean australian miss be.
dozens of heavily armed police surround cafe in sydney is martin place.
probably do not broadcast the vision tho ...
they will want to post something. i am thinking towards damage control.
stop it you are not helping by tweeting or broadcasting this.
oh this is definitely helping the authorities, .
should not the faces of armed police be blurred ?
get your priorities straight. do not tweet this shit.
please stop tweeting gear and movements of police !
so we know they are doing something.
should these images even be posted online at all ?
what is happing in has nothing to do with . these terrorist groups do not represent islam at all .
laughing at how dumb u are. read books and never talk about something u do not know
reveals itself for exactly what it is, every day, in terror attacks around the world
has no place in civilized society is. its just a death cult
stick it up your towel headed ass
fuck you i know more than you and muslims are killers
did the crusaders represent ?
i see your book of magic and raise you with mine.
they do not protest at because they are too busy hi living at the mosques
this flag is not written in hebrew either ! but in arabic !
god cannot be made of atoms because atoms need an organizer. you can not organism yourself
. they should understand how innocent muslims suffer cz of them.
keep living in denial. actually they represent islam more than you.
; jew hater. muzzies always blame their backward cult on others.
bullshit ... they do. is a dangerous and vile religion.
if photo was on it would you hold him responsible ?
he lives in a world of denial
harry potter is fiction because the author of the book herself says and the book its says so
that means in a terrorist ... k
this is the result of your long time denial to the terrorism and brutality of israel
oh this terrorist fuck in is as muslim as they come.
and still people choose to deny. political correctness produce a generation of dumb people. afraid.
i would really like to believe that, but the list of banned terrorist groups suggests something different
all the best then take 1. 6 billion muslims to court and get them prosecuted
i never said all are responsible, but it is clearly impossible to converse logically with you.
use brain dude ... the media is eating all of ur brains. use common sense !
a re tweet that is your answer ??
he represents part of surely. it is not a buddhist flag.
the innocent people are not held hostage by the media only muslims so use your brains
bullshit every is a potential terrorist
if violence had repeatedly been done in his name, then yes i would. logic - try it
any is a potential terrorist
do not tweet police movements . do not tweet photos of police , their faces , their location , anything
i am baffled by people and tv crews actually talking and showing pics of where police are.
media should ' know this.
why twitter and social media needs to be removed, also it is a tool to radicalize folks ...
australian muslim youth handed out 2000 flowers and 3600 water bottles to people in sydney

speaking from the other side of the world, my respects for your comment brother.
its unknown if the gunmen is muslim at all yet or using muslim symbolism for scare tactic
who are australia is radicalised muslims ?
you keep that simplistic view to yourself. i know much better than that.
right blame it on muslims .... spread hatred, what do you expect in return !
is terrorists are the same as everyone else. they love to kill people !
all i mean sunnis !!
they do not represent the mainstream islam and muslims, few lunatics do not make it whole
i do know and i am dead sure its beyond your perceptional capacity. enjoy spreading lie
all of them
mostly they are underground in syria.
tweets like this only make things worse, you complete and utter morons.
is this really the time to be tweeting this ?
same as they are worldwide their tiresome msg is has been same for centuries : convert or die
do they throw boomerangs gimme a break.

why are you disgusted by it ? did i miss something ?
i have been boycotting journalism for years. still has not gone away ...
certain media outlets are reporting irresponsibly.
the point here the news covering it irresponsibly.

we all know who this idiot represents ; why do we have to be so polite about it ?
you know him personally do you ?
look piss off mate block me because your talking out of your are !
sounds important. why should not it is covered by the news ?
his ignorance and willingness to assume what the media is reporting is true is killing me.
well what is the ? it is hard to not be curious.
i have been following as i find it the most reliable and least sensationalist.

the police look pretty op is over ! thats how it looks to me !
is this good practice to be posting these pictures in the middle of their operation ?
you know you went too far when the big boys show up !
share photos after the situation has been resolved. assume all hostage takers know how to use twitter.

good job to the new police. you should all be very proud tonight
trouble with reading comprehension ‚Äú eh ? sounds vividly similar to you !
... says the dead hostage was killed by the gunman. yet dip shit sean blames police.
i do not think even confirmation from god can convince a deluded twat like you !
absolute rubbish. your tweet was not stating a fact.

so you accuse me of jumping it just because i was being attentive unlike you ?
2 3 seriously injured you insensitive moron !
you couldn‚Äôt afford a research assistant from the likes of me. piss off you obnoxious american.

great work guys my thoughts are with everyone involved !
crazy gunmen can‚Äôt be controlled or held accountable like
all over the news. try 7. 2 dead. 3 badly injured.
you should be the one admitting that you were just plain slow in keeping up with reality !
2 people feared dead. my condolences to their families and loved ones.
no one is reporting it but 7, not the most reliable news source.
listen up deluded i am not gonna waste my time putting up with your ridiculous banter.
are you having trouble with reading comprehension ? seems so.
i will be honest , the multi-faith prayer vigil is making me a little teary .
try hard and see better results ! love ya stuff keeps !
oh. that makes it fine and dandy. multi-faith and bugger multi-gender.

and wanting to speak to australian pm (also unconfirmed) .
people in the middle east are extremely concerned about extremism, but i guess you are not.
absolutely in we have leaders trillion airs, of course on paper they are beggars
why is this not breaking news on your us channel ?
is pretty good and that is the network the republicans wanted to kill off
this is being called a sage. not a track. people have hash tagged it as
yet instead of covering the story you are showing viral videos
the hostages are pinned up against all the windows. they can not really do anything.
corruption is an act of treason, root of all evils ‚Äú - that is true !
yeah that is about 75 dollars in us or 100 in euro
yes they but they do not cover breaking news.
the flags are covering the windows.
are you doing bitching about immigrants in canada if you are one of them

i admire how the australian police have dealt with so far . patience . communication . no bullets fired .
the problem is when he fences defeat from fatigue it can end badly.
with one hostage taker they just have to wait for him to wear down.
well said thank you for your kind words
you are a damn idiot chris !

australian pm abbott expected to speak soon on " reported hostage-taking incident " in sydney , reports -
well hurry up slow coach fuck you tony
we do not watch u
rest assured , in a non-judgmental way , we are monitoring sydney , australia is ongoing workplace incident .
we should also sympathize with the dramatic ordeal the hostage taker went through.
that is funny.
in other words refuses to call this a muslim terrorist act.
that about sums it so sad !
because that is what the leader of the free world should do first.
wants to give the hostage tacker ‚Äú
you win the hands down. keep it coming !
hate it when chocolate connoisseurs rise up and bully an oppressed muslim that way.
and will continue to do so until we can morph it into an argument to disarm the conservatives

massive respect to today. their professionalism and calmness under such circumstances is amazing. ‚Äú
many great officers in this force.
yes rt massive respect to today. their professionalism and calmness under such circumstances is amazing
this is a man with a gun . not a religion . this is a man with a gun .
calm down do not use this to fulfill your prejudices.
perhaps i am just not as frightened as you are sir.
and you are an f'n idiot.
a little bird told me one or more of the perpetrators has explosives why police expanded perimeter
that is true. we need to put this incident in perspective.
see the association between one religion and all the red ?
he is a man with a gun inspired by, you damn blind fool !
how ' bout you do not use it to reinforce your nauseating political correctness.
guess my prejudices turned out to be correct, huh sir ?
calm down mate. do not jump to conclusions just yet.
maybe the flag is a hint ?
almost as dangerous as the terrorists are the left wing apologists for terrorism
they also say they treat is forces and commanders in israeli hospitals, why is never dishes israel
but we do not know that he is israeli yet, he may be just mentally unstable
how do i know the sun will rise tomorrow ? experience. history.

you just got yourself a new follower
for their incredible efforts in the share the tag and show the love
while all eyes on - 5 shot dead in philadelphia , in the much bigger acceptable terrorism of us gun
whats wrong with the world. why can not we all live in peace
bullets are for defending yourself or for target practice or hunting.
the trend continues ‚Äù. there should not be gun licenses ...
the problem is not it is the people, criminals.
could well in that case.
if we sure need to take better care of our veterans.
yeah and they want them back ! hey sucks when the crimes are the only people with guns ...
what about knife crime or hammer crime or hand crime. cars kill more people than guns
what is the solution confiscation, banning of firearms ?
if its things that kill ‚Äú that your worried about. do not fret there are lots
with porous borders and more than 300 million guns, do you believe criminals will ever be disarmed ?
muslim extremists are always so open to reason and negotiation . this should end well .
we are all born and people like you brainwash children into believing stories without facts.
well this is all historically documented and verified even by non-muslim intellectuals and historians.
perpetual evil against civilized islam truly is the ‚Äú religion of p.e.a.c.e ‚Äú.
u said ignorance then said adam and eve in the same sentence. ...
sacrifice a few to save the majority. only 2 animals against 13.
i meant the leap to blame means no ones really checking,
of course it is a muslim no other normal people do this shit dirty dogs
just do not water board them. that is mean !!
time to go live a special anthony curia show !
just seen the scenes from sydney . tho gets with the people & amp ; their families of those inside
have they reported how many people are inside the cafe ?
not far from wish i could meet you
hey jams how are you ??
what happened to meiji you biggest fanüòâilysmüòò
i am anxious about a case
no real time operational footage or on the ground movements will be shared by the media to ensure terrorists are
so unlike media who provided live coverage of mumbai 26/11 attack !
channel 7 building 20 meters away was evacuated
can u teach journalism to some of our asshole journalist ?
and i think sky news is right there too.
lesson for media who want exclusive footage of any event at the cost of innocent lives.
cannot happened without the help of some indians. there are some traitors inside india which want terrorism
this is how media shut work. god will not forgive ur 26/11 shame.
media should take a lesson !!
i would love it if we never publicly identify this crazed gunman . no name . no photo . no
congrats on your tweet !
hey any chance that will happen ?
i agree he needs to fade into obscurity
just kill them. that is all i ask. is it too much ?
no chance. there will always be that one news station.
really hope they just put him on a plane back to where he came from.

is it action of reaction ?
i think white extremism quite often gets passed off by whites as anomalous behavior of a sick individual
here it you condescending twat :

but is common in every violence
check meaning of straw man. , son.
um actions in the uk etc. nah never.
he is a true psychopath.
yes v never see non muslim doing this but v see muslims crashing planes on the building
often the flag. the gesture was changed when us entered war.

my neighbors are there is nothing wrong with them just people getting by as best they can
disliking does not mean being anti-muslim. muslims are people, while islam is a political system
agree however community does not need coddling, it needs support to weed out this evil
many lone wolves can make a pack !
we must consider this iranians hardships that brought him to take on such a peaceful endeavor ....

the terrorist is winning as he is still alive.

i would not really call us democratic. all our democratic rights are revoked through over-regulation in australia
and a eventually.
well time to put controls in place before more die
i hope this scumbag does not expect legal aid if he survives this
would just tell them to say hands up. do not shoot. solves everything here.
the community is equally strong against any acts of violence towards our country.
well said. kudos to you and andrew scipio
they have the same habits
disclaimer unless your arriving on a boat .... signed
if you give in to fear, the terrorists win.
i condemn the sydney cafe siege of innocent civilians ... such terrorism and negativity has no place in 21st century
go strap on a bomb you idiot.
but nuclear bomb is essential for 21st century civilization ???
i agree with you saab
wrong some misguided people think so
yet in it does.
all such enemies of humanity must be hanged or shot dead in full public view.

tony abbott : " we are a free , open and generous people and today we have responded to this
hub v today meet yesterday edit tomorrow detail devils
hey you should speak for yourself !
being free and open with islam is what is gotten them into this mess
if only he displayed those tendencies
as we lay down our head in the safety of our homes tonight , countless hostages face an uncertain night

very little movement at the lindt cafe . one person , we believe to be the gunman , walking toward
the police let back into the channel 7 studios.
he obviously does not care. it is all about ratings, not about people is lives !
and if no net service he can not put anymore you tube aids up
you tube aids of hostages now online. search for joel heart
i do not have them but if you look on youtube
must be as only showing as posted for under an hour
you tube aids have been removed from the site fyi
it would be doing a great job, reporters should respect the sensitivity of the operation
you guys know of the youtube videos with the hostages listing demands right ?
yup i know they do too, we have one
for is sake ! let it go, jackals !
why is this not being reported ?????????
what about the videos posted online ?
can you please post those videos ?
can stop him for safety sake ?
hence why it is important to not tweet about the police !
you stop tweeting your rubbish and let the police do their job !
you would think they would have done that.

we are all hoping along with seeing the hostages safely back with their families
mosques , synagogues , churches hold unity prayers
yeah com all have a different god

they always fart knocker but every time they do its ignored üò†
funny i do not see catholics taking hostages, beheading unbelievers or crashing planes into buildings ...
churches unity prayers ‚Äù
possessed by they are not partnered but the same
catholics do not normally wear turbans you mean ?
churches hold unity prayers who ?
the pope himself not so long ago condoned war against isis ' so-called beheading
i question your
people r true suckers if they think islam is a peaceful religion.
yeah and that one is the catholics
good. can it be sooner ?
is always a necessary partner for their cause.
churches hold prayers for the safety
. there is no unity when one of these religions has an agenda to conquer the others.
always careful to not comment, they are a spent force anyway. consort with nazis.
citizens wising up to the catholic sham, scam.
they should do this every day not only when sh*t hits the fan

australian pm abbott : motivation of perpetrator in sydney hostage situation is not yet known -
probably a false flag from some rogue usa agency
if it were they would all be dead already.
pay no attention to flag flying in window
i am hoping that it is not masterminded by cia/fbi agents
no one fully knows what is happening with the but we do know anti-muslim and ignorant speculation is not needed
yes sill people this will make abbott xmas
i feel sad for you now go and rant at someone else
two of them inside that cafe apparently are.
hard not to be cynical ...
and the fact that you are not afraid to be called racist is something to be proud of ?
you are embarrassing yourself with your half baked fear mongering
too bad not enough of them are not. islam is a problem.
what race is then ???
us statistics show majority of terrorist attacks on us soil not by people affiliated with islam.
except the small detail of 9/11
i made up did i ?
we do not need it we need tolerance
terrorists really who is the loon here ?
i she not holds my breath. all those false flag tweets about the boston bombers
nothing racist about resisting horror, zealotry and ignorance.
. not all ‚Äù take hostages in sydney
that is to say you are part of the problem, not the solution
you get your data from a website called loon watch and expect to be taken seriously ?
flag not a strong hint ?
you are cheering on the problem. hatred and racism and stirring up trouble. you are truly awful
here you data since 1980 : islamic extremist terrorism at 6%
how many have that killed, enslaved or ethnic cleansed ?
. 5,042 people killed in november 2014 alone by islamic jihadists per bbc.
which is irrelevant because there has been no irish related terrorism on the mainland for many years
i will pay that as a damned good burn.
this all we sorry to be cynical
it is not brave to be afraid of otherness
though as has little it is overwhelmingly white. uk would have heavy ira legacy.
i am not sure you even know what i am talking about. sigh
be nice and use your brains. be tolerant and wise and kind.
appeasers will be first into the bunker howard !
keep your skip white to yourself
and how are you helping anything howard ? you are an intolerant fool
try selling some of your wine to devout muslims then !!!

the incident in sydney is disturbing . such acts are inhuman & amp ; deeply unfortunate . i pray for

you forgot to mention the has nothing to do with islam !

i suppose they could stand there wailing.
some will say this is a modern phenomenon but these were pricks before they owned a mobile
what is wrong with that ? what should people b doing ?
the irony of telling these people off via twitter is amazing.
what the hell is wrong with people ? it is not movie filming !
do not think anyone is blaming the phones
not taking fucking series. are you an insane person ?
people have been doing that ?
is the sydney hostage taker a muslim because of the flag hoisted ?
of a man of your stature should not ask such silly questions sir
no probably a terrorist who does not have a religion
i do not know. is that a logical conclusion to make ?
if the religion teaches him that then do you blame him ?
you bury your head in the sand ? these are your wake up calls
almost all terrorists r inspired by their holy book duran, so they he a religion
can not take reality ? stupid boy !
these r so called ' religion of peace '' needed like

you park have lost any credibility in my eyes. you are racist and an irresponsible provocateur.
there are people who still believe 9/11 was not terrorist act. 2 words - useful idiots.
unbelievable. how is it an act of terrorism ?
what is a jihads park ?
holding hostages at gun if it not terror how would you define ? what constitutes terror ?
it is not an is flag.
what gain is this man achieving ?
are you seriously comparing with the sydney siege. omg !
yes. martyrdom and glory is every terrorist is dream.
religion has now become a drug to feel powerful. even though it means shit.
he is forced hostages against the windows holding up islamic flags. it is an act of terror.
calling it terrorism loses credibility ? targets civilians. promotes ideology. exploits media. what does qualify ?
give it a break. can you confidently tell me park if it is a terrorist act.?
back in 1986 a man called martin bryant killed 35 people in tasmania. was that terrorism ?
it is not an is flag. as a muslim you should know what the flag says.
it could be a chocolate delivery gone wrong and nothing at all to do with islamic terrorism
why not ask you you seem to know better of everything here.
you are right. we should wait and see.
so it is white people like me that are the terrorists ?
what gain did the hijackers achieve ? glory and martyrdom in their minds.
the gunman is just holding the flag of tweed in the window as a gesture of interfaith friendship !
it is not an act of terror !
it is a peaceful protest against capitalism !
sir are u in right now ?
absolutely no mention that chocolate appears to be jewish.
useful idiots have habit of putting words in other mouths.

if you are ignorant , this is the most important thing you will see today .
same in western society. nazi is, etc
goes without saying i want every idiot to drop dead, need 2 offers to help theygotmen
it seems like most white st africans where yes.
more museum propaganda to cover up the globalist jihad movement. take a hike ahmed.
let is go back a few years. apartheid, slavers, segregation, etc it ebbs and flows
incorrect. you mean to say it is not convenient to your premise
well then any good explanation genius why the 1. 57b have not cleaned up their mess
all this is a non requiter.
it is a historical fallacy. none of these ideologies have popular support today.
i get your point. mine is that muslims cannot be neatly divided in jihadists and moderates.
false analogy. none of those organizations enjoy broad support in any segment of western society today.
propaganda like this is what prevents us from actually having a debate about islam. extremely deceitful.

has evolved into a more civilized form. islam needs to do the same.
for the love of ... it is not racism. a belief is not a race.
these kinds of apologetic are going to endlessly delay addressing the very real problems caused by islamism.
another another atrocity. 84 children shot dead in school. defend that.
calling of humanity shit ? that is why mr. bigot to
why are u defending is and kkk ?
extremist spare no one that is my point, muslims are effected the most by this terrorism
where have i defended either ?
do not know much about morocco, but malaysia ...
because you know it is true. muslim countries are intolerant brutal shit holes. the end.
idiots always have an excuse for terror, do not mind. they are idiots !
wow that is one broad racist statement you big bigot
calling of humans shit ??
colonial intervention left a mess in the muslims world will take another 25 yrs to clean up
. do we care right now what the reason is ???
not an apologists cause i hate fundamentalist of all religions equally
police have asked media outlets not to reveal the demands the hostage taker has made .
bit late for that have you got a flag and the pm is number ?
it is a bit too late for that. everyone knows.
too late for that it is all over the twitter feed.
media should once been listening all day about not releasing anything !
and only 1 has. and i wont be watching them for the duration.
really that is about 7 hours too late. yeah great coordination & amp ; control of info
i figured that was the case, despite protestations otherwise.
seems to be a bit late for that, eh ?
not over but 5 hostages escaped ...
police have asked media outlets not to reveal the demands the hostage taker has made. ‚Äù
sending my thoughts and prayers to everyone in sydney
a very dark day for all of us. scary
so much i know how much u love sydney and australia.
and counting .... this is getting out of hand.

thank you. this really hit home for me
sending my thoughts and prayers to everyone in sydney ‚Äù ‚ù§Ô∏è
australians say " i will ride with you , " showing solidarity with muslims amid the sydney siege
you are simple minded and misinformed lao
say i will ride with you, ‚Äú showing solidarity with muslims amid siege
. their statements are baseless bullshit. have them sorted their mosques and idiot imams
extremists are a not islam as a whole.
perhaps prominent should show solidarity and condemn these acts of terrorism.
is study the koran, surat, and habits. you will see.
please keep going with your hypocrisy, i am laughing so good right now
i will ride with the hostages today
and a hypocrite mg do you see what you are tweeting ? hahahhahahahaha
indians : omg omg . can not believe this . god is cruel . today , bomb blast in imphal
many also think is the capital of australia.
please do not blame if mm screams at & amp ; is muted at
where the bomb blast took place moron
i was rat shopping, among my fellow indians, not fun.
same goes for pm he tweets for sydney but nothing on offal
......... just put the q to the great, its in uk
and they do it in the name of god
. i think cm is not in india.
reactions are based on relations and not geography ... the rest is just news ...
emergency svcs continue to line the streets of central sydney . no specific threat , but they are poised .
if they have to go somewhere in a hurry, that camera is getting bowled
something tells me there is a little more going on than a guy with a gun
what is with the recent sirens ?
thanks for the great coverage.
and many are draped with christie tinsel.
good spot we just re positioned.
you are being very reassuring in this day of crisis

yes you are bravo
because the actions of one are unfortunately and incorrectly assumed to reflect all.
well they would say would not they !
thoughts and prayers for a peaceful resolution to the current situation in sydney .
i know. that happened in every country. all ignored for the sake of greed. imo
it will never happen ... pray all you want.
look at there flag and tell me what they are
i want to see the police seize the place
but what really annoys me is that asia first warned back in the 1990 is and it is happening
those offenders need to be placed under arrest and brought to a court of justice.
exactly they are terrorists.
hope a sniper blows these bastards away ... make the next jihad think twice !
why is it such a big deal ? people have become sniveling cowards.
nothing involving ends in peace, ever
unfortunately that is how i read it
you will not get any opposition from me and agree
this is clearly unacceptable and un-australian
press council confirms " at least one " complaint against daily telegraph special
i have also made a complaint. surely this breaches the principles of accuracy and avoidance of harm !
the real number would be closer to 10,000 i imagine. at least i hope so.
why let facts get in the way of a good scoop ?
where do i complain about their moronic customers who make this level of crap profitable ?
there will be more rt : press council confirms at least 1 complaint against daily telegraph
the siege is ongoing and they want to put that shit on the front page ? wtf
i hope i am not the only one who went to the effort of filling out a form ?
only one daily tell me crap
it is almost as bad as the act its self.
there will not. these people will be arrested and have the book thrown at them.
australia is pm says there are " some indications " the sydney siege may be politically motivated
it costs the democracy : you are in nato ? receive a bonus as isis !
oh cut the we all know it is .....
so was that a political banner he held up or a religious banner ?
why give it media time they feed off it
how long did it take to work that out offs ?

well the worst of sydney is the nut job holding hostages in a cafe ...
those terrorists in are sub-human animals modern day nazis they should be killed period
so basically it is like a normal day in the usa then
. being is not ‚Äú racist ‚Äú islam is not a race. sheesh.
mouthy say it ai not so. üòè
stay safe down there.
that reaction highly unfortunate but let is not lose focus on who the despicable criminals are here
probably partly to do with this
this is the page can not figure out how to link to the post
gotta right click the time stamp :
i thought the worst of sydney was in that cafe holding hostages.
all my prayers are going to the hostages in sydney .. and all not muslims are terrorists .. it is

14 dec : australian muslim youth handed out 2000 flowers and 3600 water bottles to ppl in sydney
that was an amazing gesture of humanity. that is spirit of australia that we all know. australia
nice gesture but sad it is needed ... it is like having to apologize for merely existing
it was a part of our islamic awareness day, no apologizing
via youth handed out 2000 flowers and 3600 water bottles to ppm in sydney
that is jihad may allah reward you all
bless them this just made my morning
forget that we are promoting sharia & amp ; jihad, here. have some water.
this is how we communicate love, peace and caring each other
yes they like to celebrate a victory.
the backlash against the elephant in the room ‚Äú backlash that never comes alas !
that is not suspicious at all. what is really going on here ?
our thoughts are with everyone in sydney . please do not share any videos or demands from the people involved
for this i know they will appreciate this
authorities request media to show restraint . not give out details of even gunman is demands or operations ( worth
you just told us about not revealing demands but news laundry posts the same now. indian media ?
. the west has learned from 26/11
thank god sagarica not in sydney.
y only even margin war where brownie scoring greedy reporter got few of our soldiers killed !
authorities must thank mm who taught them ‚Äú what not to do ‚Äú.
gives away locations of policemen/army to the terrorists.
if were she old have called iran attack on foe
terrorist prefers to speak to instead of negotiators for their demands
unlike authorities during
left out d joker covering iraq from jordan and calling it ground zero.
. amp would have turned out a lot different :
media did similar thing during 26/11
how can 1 call on idiots who repeat lies to learn ? indian pretend to be honest idiots !
characteristic of majority of in india. what to do ?
but in media gave running commentary on security forces moves during 26/11 terror attack
terrorists are missing can she go to australia ?
yes true terrorists are not interested in negotiating, but in publicity.
media must learn from australian media how to report when matter concern to national security.
... worth emulating for whom sir ?
u left out the king of all ‚Äú arab ‚Äú and his wannabee raoul kansas
in australia , sydney siege tests delicate truce with muslim community , by
what truce there is no truce. they are only bidding their time
there is no truce as there is no need for one. saying there is incorrect.
a crisis not just for the australian government but for the australian muslim community as well.
thanks so much for sharing. just added it here :
another puppet being used against muslims,
there is no truce because is a religion of violence
and kick the muslims out if they commit crimes.
to hell with community ‚Äú.

inform me by twitter. are there jehadists ? dear soft,
you can not condemn an entire race , nation or religion based on the actions of a few radicals ,
love the first 4 words in your bio üôàüôâüôä
.... future that will change ?
only very few people can maintain the perspective that you have in this hour of crisis.
said the well meaning
you can not terrorize the entire country based on the actions of few ..... keep in mind .....
indeed not a question of race or nation. it is this religion of islam that creates zombies.
actually i i condemn islam and i also condemn you, for talking total crap
i look forward to you jumping to the defense of christianity when the next child abuse case is aired
you can blame their ideology.
this is the world we now live in . literally metres from the cafe with phones & amp ; cameras
why the fuck are they doing it ?
it is crazy sad ! rubberneckers to a hostage situation ! ughhh
i do not know what is become of the human condition

what does this honestly say about us ?!
its these guys wanted publicity and we gave it to them
even after the reports of bombs. they still stay.
they love it. they want blood !!!

so that is why the train was not all that packed this argo.

where them barbaric acts of terror not performed by muslims ? üôàüôâüôâ
i would argue that a significant majority of violent muslim extremists see themselves as defensive, not conversion-minded.
do you agree that it is the ? üòÇ
that is a really stupid thing to say
keep your head buried in the sand üôäüôâüôà
list of terror attacks in what context were these people murdered ?
then that could be
a lot of people would describe buddhism as a religion of peace, is why i mention it specifically
personal ideologies that have nothing to do with the true essence of islam
but even it has violent religiously-motivated adherents ! mostly similar motivations to violent muslim hicks, really.
it is in your book.
a renaissance is inevitable. just not in our lifetime
believe when decide to globally carry out holy jihad, i will be their biggest critics
oh well. they all can not be winners.
personal ideologies it is in the duran & amp ; there is plenty of examples üôàüôäüôâ

wants to send you 1 safe passage (5,718 bits/$2. 00) collect
and disbeliever is sort of more complicated category than it sounds, is my point.
i would say it is fairly safe to say that buddhism is far more peaceful than islam
that is sort of meant to refer to then-pagans and existential threats to islam.
history is written by the victor.

sydney siege highlights rise of islamist extremism in australia
criminal idiot. he has hostages holding up muslim flag.
oh come on bullshit ! ‚Äú : sydney siege shows rise of islamist extremism in australia ‚Äù
take a look at the script on the flag of saudi arabia, then take a look at that
it is true he did not take hostages.
what happened with intel agencies destroyed us in the name of us-led afghan jihad 1979
nor are they taking hostages. nor are buddhists, hindus, or atheists.
well said carol.
you need to report on christian extremism in america.
it highlights one criminal idiot. ‚Äú : sydney siege highlights rise of islamist extremism in australia
that is what they are trying to do to turkey : create another park but this time more difficult
are not the ones flying planes into buildings, beheading people around the world.
why they are not beheading aid workers ....
call it extremism . call it hatred . but do not call it " islam " . do not slander
more than thousands millions.
right path does that include death to apostates and torturing to death of adulterers ?
your both dumb i say that as a genius
someone already corrected me you unoriginal creep.
learn about science. your myths are poisoning the world.
you need to inform your fellow muslims then as most seem to think it does
learn about myths. your emperors are poisoning this world too.
you are .... as a genius ‚Äú

thank but no thank you.
i have. i am not. you are wrong. trust me.
and i said judge by the theological teachings not by the attitudes of certain people
thank you sir. i invite u to accept islam before u die.
so you are and anti-isis ? we can agree that assad is horrible.
there are liars that use the taqqiya, lying to protect their faith.
till arose when nobody wanted to help.
what does the religion of peace teach ?
you can not conflate criticism of a faith with hatred or bigotry.
no. they are saving it. you are wrong.
i would love to go over it all with you if you truly wanted to learn.
the former president yeah, he was horrible too.

i should have guessed appreciate your work.
do not fox news will be all over this ‚Ä¶ well, worry.
disagree re point no 2. not-for-attribution is perfectly respectable and often more forthcoming source
interesting re tweeted. did they have this in hand when they reported gabby affords died ?
i do not trust media ... period ... whenever possible, i try to get independent first hand sources
you do not want to be the one who believed the hype. a handy guide via
last one esp. ‚Äú : re : sydney, outlets will get things wrong. ‚Äù‚Äù
1 indisputable fact some news reports will be wrong. use is guide :
will be posting a variation of this in my classroom asap
actually i contributed to the making of that guide.
can you at least confirm that the hostage takers are members of the bush family ?
in if you heard it on fox news/murdoch outlet, suspect systematic bias
you forgot get on with your own life ‚Äú.
mt as reports come in from sydney, remember that news outlets will get things wrong.
and is disturbingly realistic and thus re tweeted ...
super guidance here mt reporting on sydney, news outlets will get things wrong.
excuse the double things. ‚Äú
none does that mean you do not trust any news reports ?
" if you use public transport , wear religious attire and do not feel safe " - search the hashtag
not just everyone needs to get involved !! & lt
love my country and my city because of this
not just ... all of australia needs this.
if you are we have gathered news on multiculturalism from various medias around the world :
i saw the news about the hostage taking
so much respect for you jenna
i am fucking love you mg

well done better late than never.
terrorist ways to seize attention and control civilians must end by aims and non-violent methods of mahatma gandhi
not funny is a manifestation of the devil. . or stands for. god protect us.
need to invent sniper rounds that can carry out beheading. equal treatment shut be dished out !
i bet they are doing that right now.
police need to bring in their best snipers to end.
an argument breaks out in crowd watching after one man goes on anti-islamic rant . he is told " muslims
see anyone can carry on like a moron. it takes no effort at all.
look an bigot & gt ; & gt ;
you are talking to uninformed idiots - waste of time.
they bloody are * !
wash the sand out of your angina you whinging merlin
u r against who is brown/black. btw, judaism-christianity-islam fall under same group. nazi luke
yawn whatever.
i am against bigotry not people - there are many great muslims ! but the faith preaches bigotry !
yes and i would be worried if it had significant followers !
that is a good analysis of a single sentence. well played.
i have more of an idea of what is occurring than you ever will. enjoy your delusion
when people defend faith they do not realism they are defending bigotry.
have you read the old testament ? you could make the same argument of christianity could you not ?
trying to politicize this terrible incident = a grade moron
not just stupid - very stupid.
you do not. thanks for trying, now get lost.
read the amp ; do not speak until you do.
3rd world desperate trying to drag 1st world into the sewer ! you are very stupid.
you are intelligent the people bagging you are not.
bury your head in sand buddy.
real victory of those forces will b 2 guides us all down a path of replicate their hate
oh rather than play hard to get why not just buy me flowers
dude that was sarcasm poker face
you are very ignorant amp ; stupid. you can change.
oh no has blocked me. why ever might that be ?
do not give me that sob-story. i am a victim. you are nazis
then you get what you deserve, ‚Äú mate ‚Äú.
so kiss his a **
i believe is are rightly against nazi is and are not called racists for being such.
good to speak up when racists rant - he is told ‚Äú muslims are welcome here mate ! ‚Äú
yes bringing incompetence to an office near you. stupid.
any doctrine or religion that rejects pluralism and the rights of others to religious freedom should be criticized.
just quietly you are a bit of a knob end me old chap
adapted to modernity by accepting fallibility of religion. muslims must do same to join modern world.
nobody takes you you nazi duffer
you would be good to humanity if you became fertilizer.
where do you live pmsl !
but followers of the old testament that reject the teachings of jesus seem few and far between.
ignorance is the culprit rather than outright racism, in a lot of cases.
i am against blind following of ancient texts preaching euphemism - no more no less.
it seems on that guy is holding a gun not a religion.
to be against a religion is not necessarily to be against a race.
ma'am, whites are very racist. they do not know any difference between muslims/hindus/sikhs
you can not because u r a slimy little nazi
how is that political ‚Äú thing going ?
terror is welcome here mate !! lol leftist pussy cowards !!!

couple of blokes standing round kicking types, not much to see.
my insider in the police is a parking inspector from sutherland. he is got nothing for me.
i can not believe the stupidity of what they are showing
it slays me that this even needs to be said. use your heads, people.

sick i reckon prior is behind it all.
is a gentlemen ' game ... it does'nt divers such foolishness .... u r right kp
the world is a fucked up place. let is hope so
our thoughts are with those poor people and their families !
my thoughts are with all the muslim australians having to deal with the islamaphobia around the promoted by media etc
the key word in my tweet to her nathan is ‚Äú first ‚Äú
there is not actually such a thing as a muslim flag.
what a wacko. apologist. sick
because the most important thing in this hostage situation is to not offend muslims
is got to say it. united airlines flight 93 ...
is your country worth it ?
it sickens me that there are sick fucks like still in this country.
too easy being an arm chair critic.
fear is a strong master !
rather than the innocents caught in the, u should be in there singing kumbaya with the islamic psychopath
i would rather know it is islam driven, goes a long way to rid them of us.
i would if i had a gun and a machete to my head.
and your thoughts for the hostages are ...... where ?
i would not hold up an islamic flag ...
the bastard would probably shoot them !
random are also innocent. the acts of a few does not represent them all.
i will save my thoughts ‚Äú for the hostages.
i might wrap up some nice juicy bacon with it !
do u think its claus in there with a gun u fucking apologist turd.
do not want that filthy rag anywhere near my shit !
i would wipe my are with the muslim flag. fuck islam !
in the circumstances i doubt up complain. walking out alive would be a priority.
if everyone refused to hold up that flag ...
surprisingly i can do both but then my brain is bigger.
should not have said ‚Äú first. ‚Äú you did not mention them at all.
ah yeah that is right.
... yeah screw the people who are actually in the cafe, low.
our country is free for the taking because we are cowards.
there is no such thing as an islamic beheading. you are not really dead.
maybe a bit of hatred of muslims would have been a bit of help in the cafe ...
terrified hold up an islamic symbol fuck no.
i would not even wipe my are with it !!!!!
i get what u mean
the 500,000 + muslim-australians are also victims and targets of todays attack .
they are not.
there are real hostages out there. stop being pretentious moron.
actually we if you have not been discriminated against i suggest you do not talk
only if they identify as such.
really are always the victims. even when atrocities are committed by muslims
your enablers 500,000 + muslim-australians are also victims and targets of today attack.
the victims are in that cafe ...
i was thinking that the hostages were the victims. what a fool i am
not supposed to is a stupid notion anyway !
because they are going to be continuously discriminated and verbally abused for none of their actions
the best source for the latest updates on is . follow , & amp ; for transport info
is a gutter superstition that glorifies death and violence !
cut all network inside the cafe. complete news blackout.
here does not really make sense latest is a re tweet ?
shutdown all mobile network in the area. complete news blackout
one of our best sources of reliable news is he has sources everywhere and knows how to verify news

haron monis , the true muslim , who believes in allah & amp ; muhammad , is terrorizing sydney ,
maybe cut of appeasement politics like in india.
but a little correction.
has become human surely unlike most of her coreligionists who are stuck in that inhuman cult.
was nothing but is altered ego.
i think u r a much they pay u to tweet always against us.
if main murdered his why was he out free ?
it is shame liberal media calling it politically motivated when he is shouting about allah all the time
who are u !!! have u done !!! or still a üòÇüòÇ
do not forget to add all muslim all are not like that.
now confirmed why you are on their hit list.!!
still can not fathom why he was given asylum in the first place
this gentleman must be a good friend of the indian media
rightly said true showing power of allah.
this monks commits no atrocity that mo himself did not, so aaron is the perfect-moslem
australians offering support to muslims on public transport who fear racist abuse using the hashtag .
keep kissing their rears.
what would not be happening ?
transporting them out of western countries would be an excellent idea.
very heartening impulse. i hope it helps, makes even a small difference.
is not a race.
you know darn well this would not be happening if the muslims in question were white.
great. should pay thanks with linda swiss chocolates

sydney siege ends : - after 16 hours - 2 dead - 3 injured - status of gunman unknown -1

i would have shot the twat right in his scull if it was my family of friends no problem
shame for the two who died and to injured copper
just realized the tweet and the hash tag contradicted each other !
this is well written and comforting as well .
maybe the wider community should be doing more themselves to stop these things happening
congratulations to them a terrific comment !!
developing : major police operation underway in sydney is central business district :
how many in would do this, you think ?
dear save the pictures for afterwards ! opsec !
4 whole from a supposed major news source.
i do not think you get my point.
someone said it may be the al nasa flag.

sydney attack latest : - 8th hour - 5 people escaped gunman demands : - speak to pm - isis
i am sure we got one of those isis flags lying around here somewhere ...
i would love one day to hear a negotiator in one this situation called the perpetrator pussies
so is someone suppose to just pull an isis flag out of their ass ?
made 2 bombs but can not take isis flags with him ? ok, ok
this feels like a false flag

i will say it again : one trained patron in sydney chocolate shop with a concealed weapon may have prevented
you can not say that ! its as bad as saying reality is real !
rt guns are illegal in the uk ‚Äú & lt ; i must have missed the memo.
the govt only bought back guns from legit owners. crims were allowed to keep theirs
yes and how many kids get shot at school because guns are legal in the usa ?
rather than check six some people choose to live with their heads buried in the ground.
all they can do at this point is bite a chocolate bar into the shape of a gun.
yeah ... schools are gun free zones. try again
it is only a matter of time in the uk. it is a slow boil over there.

the amount of support this tweet is getting is incredible, stick together aussies
careful what you post about sydney siege ; it feeds into bad guys ' actions/reactions . emergency responders need clear
fuck it is what it is
oh you the communication expert who used to feed propaganda into the dept immigration twitter feed ....
breaking some people hate chocolate, christmas, & amp ; women
has a police request been issued to avoid filming/discussing the flag ?
you are part of the problem moron. run along now.
if you are outraged at the telegraph is irresponsible reporting of , complain to the press council here .
which makes him the perfect news ltd editor
should be not sacked
have always been irresponsible with reporting i am surprised they still exist after lawsuits
bad journalism is always morally disgusting. daily telegraph is the worst of the worst.
and whilst they wait for a reply, they can read news ' code of conduct from 2011 :
. the has been rogue for yonks - editor paul whitaker should be sacked
this blatant nonsense only incites more hatred and endangers people is lives !
he is a nasty piece of work. even the people who work there hate him.
when peers give a walkway award for headline journalism i am not optimistic this will change.
australia is leader tony abbott addresses ; no questions from the media taken
it was true. in everything it is up side down
the religion of peace strikes again
well down under is below the equator. everything is upside down silly
is not ... is not trained to answer them. üòä
no questions from media taken. great this is no question time !
is leader tony addresses ; no questions from the media taken
. is all the police tape in australia upside down as well ?
maybe the is a ‚Äú working document ‚Äú.
why is the police tape up-side down ? ?
at best hiding behind woman
did not know tony takes media questions ever, he ai not trained to answer them ...
media is only concerned for the religion of the flag- not the safety of the trapped innocent hostages !

if this man was a christian we would be focusing on his mental health not his religion . why not
even if he was white with any other religion or none. bloody infuriating
two recent sieges in one in melbourne, but no christianophobia
because there is no global network of radical christians beheading children, capturing slaves and killing innocents
religious extremist gt mental health on tv ratings scale
also means must be personally responsible for all catholic ira atrocities
in they just shoot up schools w. little kids/teachers/students/office workers/everyday people/unarmed black people
i think you are trivializing this on.
that is an excellent point.
i think that is being proved to be correct dave.
police are requesting that no photos of the lindt cafe siege are shared on social media

3 of the hostages 4 wounded and the bad guy is now dead

me too. nothing has been reported which is good
mg shit that is scary, an attack of what though ?
why have you not followed me yet friend
because they had themselves believe something that is not true and they have taken that to the extremes
i am scared something rash is going to happen while on live television
what time is it there ? like 11am ?
and all surrounding offices and the opera house have been evacuated !
horrifying news about sydney hostages please remember to only blame the individuals involved not the religion they claim to operate
they are not coming home today, you need to get your priorities straight.
i know i was saying it is scary at what is happening
so important for someone like you to say this mate, thank you
thank you for saying it as a lot of people misinterpret these things
this makes me really mad low
hope you and all the people you know and work with are ok
it is so scary what is happening
well said well said
true people do not understand that is it is extremists within the religion and not the whole religion
their faces say it all . continues more & gt ;
their faces say it all. continues more sgt ; ‚Äù
if you had an ounce of consideration, they are faces would be blurred out.
they will not be fancying chocolate ever again ‚Äú : their faces say it all continues more ‚Äù
and still no cleric peers sent in to talk him down, what is going on here ?
uber is a pile of garbage .
you are really passionate about user is marginal revenue in the midst of a crisis.
sigh user is a pile of garbage. ‚Äù
the hostages are not able to get into a user, are they ?
you still have not explained why the needy ones are the rich people who can afford the costs
in extraordinary we apply different moral criteria.
it decreases the supply of rides for desperate people when they are most needed
love the market until it negatively impacts them ...
agree ... in times that are outside of human nature everyone should only make rational based decisions ...
surge pricing is great. using and then bragging about it when lives are at stake is disgusting.
needs a hard cap like baseball.
but then why would they provide a service if they are not making any money ?
what is the choice how do you get enough drivers to pick everybody up without surge pricing ?
is acting as if they have no choice ... they have a choice
you were doing so well with rational arguments and then you pulled this. disappointing
this does not increase the supply of drivers, only raises the piece for scared riders.
if you have not already deleted the app : : user is a pile of garbage.
pulling ... what it is a simple example of what happens when you remove price mechanisms.
are lives at stake ?
why are you so confident about this ? people respond to incentives in so many situations
all good. and debate is a good thing.
arguing that moral info does not impact human decisions is extremely naive.
all user has to do is not take their 20% cut in these situations.
and it only took you 983 tweets to say that.
and by your argument would not impact supply at all.
plus i do not have any information to suggest that people other than the hostages are in danger
while not achieving any of the egalitarian objectives you think it accomplishes
this seems mostly like a computer automated thing ...
is designed to solve a problem about maximizing efficiency under normal circumstances.
what does day to day at the bronx have to do with a specific terrorist situation ?
cheap how about regular pricing considering people are fleeing an active gunman.
encourage people to do as much charity as possible, then let the marketplace fill in the gaps.
you do not grasp how user works if you think its profiteering.
it is all about the fans, man.
same pay to drivers so they are helping ‚Äú get drivers on the street ‚Äú
its not like some driver says ‚Äú here is a great chance to make big money ! ‚Äú
free markets help the poor. they create supply where otherwise there would be nothing but shortages.
the hostages certainly are. this is not new year is eve or a broken train.
why would there be no cabs ?
and none at all ‚Äú is not the alternative
i agree man ... what other choice does user have in this rare and random instance ....
what is the alternative ? better to have expensive transportation than none at all
this is a really important basic point in economics that most people do not seem to grasp
i just deleted the this is bs.
like i moral obligation of drivers to give rides to those in danger is independent of pricing
both are the same to economists : a supply shortage due to an external intervention in the market.

not really much panic except perhaps for hostages and muslim women facing xenophobic attacks
does not look like the are panicking ,,, they would like a piece of news too.
fucking pussy just go in and shoot the hostage takers dead and be done with it ! !
and yet your photo shows everyone standing around calmly and watching the situation unfold. stop sensationalizing
sydney is muslim leaders express their concerns ; organisations have offered to help in ' any way they can '
no in not kidding you little girl, stop being so naive.
fuck that kill them all and let god sort them out.
waiting 4 peaceful to speak out in horror at the terrorist in australia ...........
if it were a flag that was being held up, no one would be calling this terrorism
oh here we there is always one ... kkk would be considered terrorism as well you idiot
would it replace the muslim man with a white man, would it be called terrorism ?
really somehow i can not believe it.
extremists are no longer part of the religion, it is just an excuse for them.
wow do you really think the kkk and isis are in the same league.
why i have no fucking idea
wants us to respect and understand them.
they do not know who the extremists are ! muslims are not bad people, extremists are !
i have never seen this ! this is fucking awesome !
leaving the country would be a start
the hardly get as much media coverage as muslim extremists do, because they are white
they killed people. if they had bombs i am sure they would kill the same amount.
there are so many terrorism crimes done by christian, white men, yet no one calls it terrorism
now you
please. do you think that the pope should report the kkk for all they do ?
religious leaders are fully aware of the warning signs of radicalization yet fail to report it.
to think h wants to reach out to this ppm ?? & gt ; ¬∑

just a grade idiot - why do the police not move them on for impeding the operation
the fact that i see " thank god 5sos and 1d are not in sydney " pisses me off even
a terrorist has taken eleven people hostage in a restaurant. it is pretty scary
what is going on in sydney
and people only care about the fact that 1d or 5sos is not there
i hope everything works out fine, do not worry they are in my prayers
i live in and i did not know until now mfg
it is so scary mg. why are people so bad ? i can not get it.

this is not a religious or a racial issue , it is an insane individual making insane actions . dont
lie down and die ... then the jihad is over ... i think that is how it works ?
sadly you cannot reason with extremists
the important thing is that we all realize what wonderful people matt & amp ; danielle are.
humans invented religion. what is your point ?
i apologize for having this convoy with an ignorant person obviously there is no way you will at least
as much we have a bad muslims, you have a bad christians too !
how did you work out the jihad is not a religious issue ?
yes but do it like a real muslim. make taker upon caliph and murder him justly !
why do not u he conversation with

this tweet lured out the racist worms from the woodwork.
maybe he got his ideas from the extremists who misinterpret the koran.?
was a very weird cat
will you ride with him holding that sign apparently a lot of lefties would
swords are out of date. try this for islamic extremism :
do tell the
it is a religious issue when his motives are islamic hegemony.
start there. or would you prefer to discuss your pestilent kaddish ?
bleeding heart called for hindu/sikh holocaust : page 43
so you give him the isis flag.
so you agree with me ...
has it been established that this guy is actually a muslim ? serious question. remembering andes brain.
it‚Äôs clearly religious. you‚Äôre in denial if you think otherwise. read the koran. i have.
what are you critiquing ‚Äú ? religion or islam ?
this insane individual was inspired by ... let me guess, a disney movie ?
is it not mentioned in the koran jihad ?
apologists like are only too happy to lay down and die. leave them to it.

why say all this while there are still hostages ! ?????????? ?????
name of gunman has been revealed-a man w/violent history of 50 sexual assault charges & amp ; on bail ,
probably because of his ' human rights ' or/and those pc preaching do-gooders who infest officialdom and authority
with these kinds of charges - how is he out on bail ??
we could however start talking about him being misled primarily by hateful religious discourse, correct ?
whoa meditation is pretty cool.
not but the hostage situation ... yeah.
sounds like a disenfranchised creep to me.
do not talk about cut u do not know anything
u missed the bit about him being a cleric.
i am afraid i was ionizing.
it seems very odd to me.
also claimed to be an expert in astrology and black magic.
you missed the part of him being a self proclaimed cleric. my dog is one too :
a holy man wholly unpleasant and utterly wicked !
maybe you can promote this too
sounds like a religious issue to me. also immigration.
and still free bane of democracy that lets criminals walk free
gunfire and explosions have been heard as armed police stormed the lindt cafe building in sydney
turn out to be mentally ill on day release.
stop him he is getting away !!!
being given were hostages harmed ???!!
imagine how rubbish these morons would be if they did not have their peaceful theology to guide them
my money is on this guy being an absolute amateur.
it is over 1 hostage dead and the camel fucking rag head as well
by the guy sat on twitter. you are fucking finished
gunman was reportedly " extremely agitated " , shouting as some hostages escaped .
sad times really can not wait till aliens arrive
and let authorities deal with it in a suitable and appropriate manner
do not negotiate get him on camera and hack his fucking head off then send it to jockstrap john
is not that barbaric ‚Äú ?
that is the same country that banned it is people from watching any of the world is revolutions
whatever happened to fair trials ?
china love watching the world burn that is why
we as humans need to evaluate how we are letting other humans suffer at the hands of tyrants
government should have never gotten rid of the nut houses.
hack his head off and send it to allah üëç
you think will go to war with russia ?
did beings family get a far trail
yes is testing the water at the minute regarding switching there beacons off to other air traffic
thank because without there backing western governments would have got rid of assad long before now
is a big putin tyranny and dictatorship has gone in for far too long üò†üò†
tyrants before but they need assad as he is an ally of israel. simple.
sanctions will only make matters worse plus china refusing entry to our diplomats is not too good either
and the mod still millions into israel for drone technology knowing how they have been tested on civilians
and chemical attacks by and his regime ?
bombs will not fix only innocent people will suffer
as if it was an explosive belt automatic tripping all its hostages dead
is that gunmen not a muslim
really hope hostage are rescued . but worth noting most jihadi victims are muslims
and many are killed and injured. often.
has def become a much more racist place from what i have been hearing. sad
bro i do not know about boston and norway incident
why is that worth noting ‚Äú ? does that make it all ok then ?
topic was jihads attacks and yes jihad fuckers have killed many people from australia and r real threat
and how many jihads have u faced ?
again another person straight on the defense ...
it means jihads will kill anyone who stand in their way
they will kill anyone. you do not need to qualify it.
yes cos the and norway incident were both carried out of muslims rite ?
amp most jihad perks are they jehovah witnesses or methodists ?
because we are talking about jihad violence
i wonder who commits the most terrorist acts. excluding governments.
okay cunt it was australians killed in bali by jihads ...... now fuck off ya loser
and that is it is in the book.
then why u mention for ya cunt ? that is not australia
i guess we also have to exclude male violence against women and girls.
well said sadly sunny has become very polarizing recently. he even attacks british jews for israel is behavior
why is it worth noting ?
the tortured mind of a liberal.
us guys i am neither muslim nor in australia
ignore everything before the but.
sympathies to all in australia - you guys gonna suffer in what is already a badly racist country
to americans saying the would not be happening if citizens had gun rights ... you are right , it would
your claim that more violence occurs after gun bans needs more work.
i do not know why that statement is so funny. probably because it is true
been watching from the us in the last week.
true. i guess it comes down to who is holding the gun then
because nobody in gets shot, ever. what a nation of halfwits.
not just blind about guns.
first link i clicked on google.
another cause i am bored some research before u call my comments rubbish makes u look silly.
it is so hard to fathom how a majority could condone that ! just insane
but it does keep guns to a minimum.
after watching the us news since ferguson, it is just so terrible to contemplate that it is possible
that is not research ‚Äú. please
which statement i would hate to think either were funny
i genuinely think half that country is just itching to shoot themselves a person of color.
i have lived and there is a reason i never crossed the mason-dixon southbound.
is a right wing institution. come on you can do better.
where do you get that rubbish ?
how nice of you to say
macho i think.
those poor people have been in there for 11 hours . sending all our strength and love .
thank you for thinking of us in australia it means so much x
i agree i second that
whats troubling about the time elapsing is that this man has to sleep - could make things more dangerous
start and boot these apologists for islamic extremists off please
i think they are between a rock and a hard place
keep the political issues with govt. notinnocentstaken hostage.
i think they have been asked not to say anything inflammatory as it is still an active situation
i think the 7. 62 might be a bit more effective than love and prayers
you continue to accept muslims full stop. pull your head out of the sand
i can not believe how the media thinks that they can get into the head of this terrorist
i do not think that is gonna be very helpful to them
only the soldiers of islam have the guts to bravely face women armed with coffee mugs .
and shoot a 14 schoolgirl in the head
such a bunch of cowards !
why is free and he is not ? rt if he should be free
. kinda like cops shooting innocent black kids armed with skittles.
we execute people for that. no trial. just like the taliban. america ! f yeah !
so brave are not they ...
dangerous sensationalism because someone says he is does not make him so.
hijack the thread mike brown was more into handguns and forty founders.
stupid attempt to tarnish the image of islam stopped lied
a radical muslim wants to chop off your head . a moderate muslim wants a radical muslim to chop off
ignore it like you do ?
the hostage taker is ' us ', that is ' a muslim. '
and both will fuck your goat.
this is disgusting. they do not represent us
not comparable because it is not an endemic and systematic issue as it is in your faith
so then do something about them.
no of course not. i was referring to the folly of ignoring the escalation of violent fundamentalism/wahabism
breaking : terrorist involved in sydney siege is 50 year old iranian known as isheikh haron ' .
it is time for him to go to allah
this mother fucker looks demented from his looks he sure does have mental issues kill him now
i think it is time to shake this and other seas
that explains his headband rt : terrorist involved in sydneysiege is 50 yo iranian known as sheikh aaron
yes to reunite with his virgin goat
is still alive i think a drone can take care of that.
.... time for a lead suppository !
at least so it was before obamacare, you are helped free in any emergency-room in the us.
it is a shame that australians gave up all their guns on orders of the government . now only isis
i am referring to events when israelis civilians shot terrorists during attacks.
but somehow the world do not see it that way liberty for all not victims are us
as opposed to where civilians actually stop terrorists
you might want to sort out gun related deaths in your own country before you worry about ours.
' cops ' they are spooked brave
what is spooked brave mean ?
. how many civilians stopped terrorists on american soil with their guns ?
it was not on the order of the government, the people wanted it ...
guns are still available to purchase ... on internet even
the way things are going taking guns from people is plane stupid
weep for media credibility . the australian is was tweeting channel 9 reports of 2gb ray hadley is ' rumours
the egg has 19 followers. that is all.
similar small brains ... or poorly connected synapses in both cases, mike
something wrong with anyone who listens to harley
real test for do they run with audience grabbing speculation or wait for credible facts ?
the and they can not lose what they do not have.
mediocre is putting it a bit high ...
weep for media credibility. tweeting channel 9 reports of harley is ' rumors. ' ‚Äù
and the winner of the rebekah brooks clone award :
i wonder why people who have members in the siege call ray harley not other media
and i still miss him on bbc
. i feel 4 the relatives of the hostages.
facts what have facts got to do with it ?? shame ms mark son shame
and the news limited alarmist headlines do anything but help.
i think we all know the answer to that
nobody with an gt ; 100 actually listens to ray harley, do they ?
go hide under a rock i would rather listen to ray harley wakes up to yourself
nothing that does has any credibility. i do not anything has been lost.
if they waited for credible facts, news corp papers would be empty.
people that prefer to listen to ray harley are generally classified as morons
according to 2 hostages phoned. hadley was on air at right time, that‚Äôs all
do your self a far, stop tweeting !!!!
daily terror would never let facts get in the way a headline.
no wonder people do not buy newspapers anymore.
no sorry i bet you are an abc lover mike carlton hanger on how sad what a loser !!!!!!!!!!!
grow up and go hide under a rock
to be it does not claim to be a peer reviewed journal

why so they have reason to go and invade an islamic faith country ?
what does it have to do with obama ? oh yeah, he is a muslim.
i can sleep easy thank you.

my 80 yr old refugee uncle and aunt were 4 days in siege 26/11 - its horrible
things getting ugly ... a racist bloke yelling at rest of the crowd , " muhammed is a pedophile ,
and was a rapist and pedophile.
that cannot be helpful no.
immaculate conception is history. islam is not a race. try keep up.
thanks for being unafraid to speak the truth, brother. we are all in this together.
that is all the police need to be dealing with at the moment !
so is the catholic church.
it blocked me.
. is a useless racist nitwit. that is why i blocked.
nothing to do with race ... yet again ... it is a religion .... not a race !
you are absolutely correct and you just got a new follower !
good point. you just got a new follower !
um but is a pedophile and a rapist/ not really racist
except those acts are illegal in civilized countries, not so much in 7th century islamic hell-holes
. you mean a truth teller ?
and you. greetings from !
not helping an already tense situation, but no doubt he is had an artful of appeasement !
is not a race.

indeed. great usa and new zeal and - all good friends.
that he was and the tradition is carried on today by his followers
the as defense league is encouraging racists to visit martin place
and you will die at the hands of your muslim terrorist friends
how far away is this crowd from the cafe ?
yes but had sex with camels
the camel fucker and muslims are terrorist animals
it is a death cult that should be made illegal
do not pray to a camel fucker for me just go back to the desert
you are the only one who has mentioned race by presuming i am ' white '. idiot.
white ppl , stop paralysis of analysis . all these flags say same thing : isis = saudi = taliban
i think you are right but i know what he means, he is referring to western countries.
so what left right francois flag.
is like saying a cross = england = jamaica = denmark = first aid = treasure
what r white ppm doing to stop analysis ??? that claim is ridiculous !! üí•
eat at is for friendly nonviolent service.
you have got the wrong flag on this occasion.
brotherhood .....
all these flags say the same thing , and we ,e gonna,lminate teliminateeeliminatednentlpermanently
the real problem is that people are giving it credence. it is the flag of cunts
talking like that in my opinion just incites racism

an imam , a rabbi and a priest have just held a joint prayer session for the hostages at lakemba

we have no info , police want calm , everything is speculation , and this paper wants more sales .

terrifying. hoping for a peaceful resolution with no loss of innocent lives.
every citizen of sydney has an obligation to help police etal maintain operational security around lindt cafe . do not
as an you do not want internet sleuths making this like the boston bomber search.
logical deduction of a concerned citizen, put it that way
tweeted police movements and chatter on police radio. pointed to an innocent person.
note cautionary points from 2008 in kilcullen is article :
just were you told that by police, or did you make that up yourself ?
they forced channel seven to move their cameras.
sleuths also got the ferguson cop wrong. so learn from us stupid americans.
who is sheikh man haron monis and why was he known to police and the media ?
point is ... do you want to censor all news ?
one sniper one game over
. maybe that will be done when smug greedy jews are murdering kids too ? nazi murder children.
i empathize with the situation in gaza, but was not referring to it in my original post
probably cos he took folk hostage ?
but i was .... so ?
maybe wait till hostages are free.?!
he is underwear model for pajamas r us ! everyone can see it

how do you sexually assault 47 people and get bail ? that does not seem cleaver.

man monks looks like an of !
only thing this murdoch tabloid front page achieves is to further terrorise family members of hostages
yes it is called bot buying or watching any murdoch media
disgraceful daily telegraph ... report the news accurately do not add to the problem
beyond belief that people are actually paid to produce that white
device will be fr offing on this tripe, death cult is hilarious
anyone in the terror game must be truly thankful for such assistance to their cause.
sounds about right. they keep rolling out old stereotypes instead of addressing a new multicultural audience
.... and provide insight into the values of that outfit !
why is everything so final ? hysterical.
every word and image on that page is factually correct.
unite. grow a brain retards !
this news paper is complete trash. it is alarmist and speculative.
is this the same publication as uk telegraph ?
fear is what criminals want . show no fear . the media must calm down and wait for information ,
alarming when a joke account speaks more sense than news outlets.
must not accidentally turn the tv on. let me know when it is safe again
guess he is furiously thrashing out a 3 worded slogan as we tweet !
oh guess who is going to address the nation
hey ... is this ?
just in : white house official : pres . obama briefed on hostage situation in sydney , australia -
when will he be on tv telling abbott to show restraint ' ?
he could read about it in the paper tomorrow like everything else.
i do not see why he has to be briefed on it at all.
why is obligated to do something about a hostage situation in australia ?
but it interrupted mine
i hope this did not interrupt his sunday night card game.
and went back to sleep ... zzz snore ...... benghazi ..... zzz
if you saw how turned out, last time obama helped hostages they ended up dead.
i huh. dumb.
he has called for advice.

because media is not an industry in australia. here it is business
out of affection people call him shear coup ta now.
they break problems .... not news ...
reporters ' reporting helped terrorists in 26/11 it was observed by supreme court of india
and got away with it too.
that is just respect for hostages n their families.
to various media people - if you do not know something , say so . speculation fills airtime but does
exactly. a lot of lazy and dangerous reporting today.
. does this wise counsel apply to ray harley ? for now and ever, ever more ?
sure would be irresponsible to speculate about islamist/in motivations given the circumstances.

do you take pains to mention when rapists are christian ?
so the gunman is everything under the sun except ‚Äú a muslim ‚Äú ! brilliant !
his pictures on shows him wearing clerical dress of ship sheikhs
therefore a man of as defined by isis bhaijaans and khaalajaans.

peaceful your says all
he did all this crime to get 72 virgins in heaven

a kind lady named mica drove me home after a cab that we shared from sydney iscbd was not able
do you think the militant will let the hostages go ?
no. i responded multiple times and you had nothing to offer except moral vanity
not for a white male.
did you read the article ? hardly points to widespread anti-muslim sentiment in australia
or perhaps the likes of maria could acknowledge something like this ?
here we go ... yawn. i will leave you with your vacuous moral posing
hi still with you in spirit and action re too !
congrats on your tweet !
what issues does the hash tag bring up for you ?
and i think the focus should be on the hostages rather than muslims preemptively playing the victim card
guess this does not fit your connected victim hood & amp ; bullshit ?
we can do and muslims had nothing to do with starting the hash tag.
so you repeat the same insult ?
playing the victim to a tee.
why was that the cab not able to complete the journey ?
would you drive a home if they needed a ride ?
i must have also missed the hash tag supporting jewish kids etc when they were attacked on a bus
would rather they cut my head off
the i have got no response so i will move onto insults ‚Äú.
that it is hollow that seeks to highlight a problem that does not exist.
just found an explanation of the hashtag that has came from the sydney hostage situation- very moving

wow it‚Äôs like you can see into my soul from a tweet
just like the inquisition was not catholic (bennett)
you may be delusional if you believe people think much about israel is abilities.
i can not actually find a correct image of this flag. i believe it may be new.
nice use of the dictionary i am impressed with this scholastic achievement.
mufti of says do not jump to conclusions ‚Äú havana
you rather obvious that he is correct.

you are too predictable. almost certain you would say some vacuous insipid comment
excellent call. bang on the target, bulls eye. love it.
you have not pointed out jack shit. thanks for playing the game though buddy.
and you are an illiterate sob. real toby would never make this kind of error.
black denotes jihad amp ; words typical islamic quote but not isis flag

you are an of the human condition though
to me all religious people have a mental illness. what is your point ?
there is no real it was a fictional show.
motive resistance2oppression, mental illness ... -religion us 1 tool
. the flag is correct. this is part of it in the window of the cafe.
exactly ignore any criticism you bigoted funk
i misunderstood your comment. sorry. and yes i did imply he does.
please affirm that you believe the kidnap has nothing to do w/ islamism or do shut up.
how much liberty do you wish to surrender to ensure everything is terrorist-proof ? what about malaria/tb/traffic deaths ?
what i expected from hawkins followers tba
does not matter now. he is requested an isis flag & amp ; a chat with our pm
it is just meant to represent you, at least a little.

so religion is involved ... hence blatant ha ...
fuck off you opportunist fuck now is not the time for your proselytization.
none are bigger conspiracy nuts than those still mentioning them 4 yrs later
reference and bush no ... their religion was not their driving force
that was a mere analogy imbecile liberalism ruins all things
you are an idiot irrespective of which religion you criticize that is what you fail to understand
edgy. now go back to tumble to whine about pronouns.
the source of the info sir ? btw religion can only make claims but never prove. true
it is close but has a few design details that are different.
you are stuck in 5 yrs ago. let it go. move on.
....... mumbles something about pouring water up terrorists ' noses *
you mean for fear of being beheaded at your desk too low !
you are being sarcastic yeah ?
yeah i am sure you do differential equations all day errryyyday. lol
against an not people.
you are as you are following a dick.
the elementary logical mistake in your initial comment was merely a precursor to determine the shallowness of your intelligence
dude your trolling bores me. lol
embracing religion is basically a formal certificate that you are prone to accept manipulation.
ah so it might be in the name of a different religion low
i have no disputes at all.
it is not new. it is from an obscure group. do not recall name.
oh we have a professor here ? fuck off low
black spiritual healing ... all superstitions criticizes seem to be present in this terrorist
is my name supposed to have more numbers in it
only thing cops have admitted is it is ' politically motivated) .
what a stream of nonsensical bullshit.
i did not say you did, as you surely did not imply that was applying mono causality.
then feel welcome to choke on your tongue, dickhead.
it is never taoists, always the religion of peace.
and ignoring elephants in the room is signal of poor eyesight or biased agenda.
you do not have to be a professor to recognize the fallacy in that logic of yours
my thoughts are with the hostages , their families and everyone in sydney right now .

what point does constantly televising beg copycats ? your reporters provide nothing new ...

targeted action should be taken against religious hate mongers without punishing any community
who is the garbage that supports terrorist muslim ?
once again the west refuses to call it what it is ‚Ä¶ , pure and simple !
simply if someone in had a conceal & amp ; carry outcome would sure be different

it was a ' workplace incident ' as decreed by hussein, taqiyya is
interesting article. tell why would you not deport such a scumbag ?
the forbidden word is violent. these goats will go down in history as a mockery.
i bet the family of that dead hostage might feel little different from you !
it is terrorism. this is a terrorist attack ...

your hope is the world is hope.
the afp have said the hostage taker is monitoring social media , according to guardian australia sources .
obviously did not get enough attention as a kid.
one guy starting to look like he has friends.
am more curious about why all general conversation has ceased. wondering how much control the gov has.
it is a huge safe to assume it has at least one tv, too.
which is why the media needs to stop with police plans !!
is that why things just suddenly got really, really quiet on the ?
like of has a smart-phone.
better source of news that commercial tv or radio ...
hopefully that‚Äôs not a surprise to them.
eight whys is not all technology shut down ??

the gunman is also holding 1 . 6 billion muslims hostage . islam is free from the crimes he is

guilt by association is all about the mindset of the accusers built on ignorance.
the is terrifying . but attacking and abusing muslims is exactly what isis wants . we need to pull together
your lucky ... not missing much ...
we are all we just need to stand together
your giving them a platform by having it on the news
like the only media outlet actually saying this bluntly
and what about the atheist ?
um ... why is not the project airing in queensland ? all we have is ten eyewitness news
yes pull together and stop bowing down to religious extremists.
not to mention that attacking innocent people makes that person a terrorist too.
in times of the glory of humanity must prevail. australians must rise above this mindlessness

social justice for a death cult that has no social justice. irony brain freeze.
i mostly agree with that. i was talking about your immigration point.

being gracious about mistakes can get you kicked off twitter.
fact is it would not have happened if not for failed open door immigration

nothing to do with ? are u for real ?
very little elsewhere i am afraid
difficult to know the ex ‚Äú part based on a tweet. right ?
look let is just stop the immigration programmed & amp ; stop getting involved in wars in middle east
so then why am i an anti-islam aussie liberal.?
i subscribe to the school of thought on the issue.
something along the lines of ' everything to do with islam '.
guessing you are not from american south b/c right is problem here is largely with brown people.
this is an there is many of them. they need our support.
well said. there are so many apologists in australia, ali.
we have already heard that using the flag in this manner amounts to desecration.

daily telegraph front page with comment piece " the instant we changed forever "
ignorance is not bliss when it destroys careers. watch the whole thing :
yep. that simple you dumb ass
maybe we can show you how to end these situations peacefully instead of guns blazing
so what you are saying is that times have changed and so has the concept of jihad ? smh
you also need to check some facts, but that was obvious.
' changed forever ' wtf does that mean ?
brown must have been super human to be a threat from that distance
. easy to criticize cops from your living room while being afforded the security that only police give
i would think the hilton bombing in 1978 would have been the moment where we changed forever.
please do not spread this rubbish
because that justifies shooting (to kill) a 12 year old
then it is the telegraph after all. they love a bit of islamaphobia
changed forever ! whatever does that mean ?
good. proves you can not argue with facts
look at the flag. that look christian to you ? stop being an apologist for terror
yes and you kill way more with them than islamic terrorists ever could
you are full of shit. blacks kill more blacks in black on black crime than whites !
apt via daily telegraph front page with comment piece ‚Äú
that is not the point. strangling a guy to death also pretty harsh id say
the were not prepared for this. they will pay a price for not upping preparedness !!!
. you are just the cutest.
let is not diverge from the subject at hand. looks like the jihad lost his leverage
premature those facts are sufficed to conclude that this is an islamist terror incident
rather like us police it seems then
yeah. but laura was in 1985.
wow famous rob i bet that hurts havana.
we can teach you to find & amp ; kill muslims in your country before they take hostages !
and an unproven assumption that is had anything to do with this.
you do not appease terrorists -- you kill them !!!
traditionally do not take hostages. they just blow up babies.
death cult mt : daily telegraph front page - ‚Äú the instant we changed forever ‚Äú
death cult is that ? you mean like work place violence ?
ouch what a loss.
fuck off you racist ignorant twat.

we were talking about brown and the 12-year-old. why do not you respond ?
do not see taking hostages in any of our cities. of course we carry guns !
you know very little. good luck with appeasing terrorists. you deserve our president
changed by allowing into rna extreme but obeying
how is taking hostages a terrorist mo ?
did i hear anyone talk of appeasing ? anyone ? ... ... nope
for what i can tell it related to a pier german opinion piece.
can not read byline but is that piers ?
yeah we are expert because we have been hit multiple times.
means that just popped it is cherry on the home-grown islamic terror front.

but instead of engaging in debate and potentially learning something you block ... üêì
and they are no longer welcome. its time we end your vitriol. referendum now !
yes just we allowed the extremists in !
i guess you have not heard of mohammad ali barbara then ?
are you saying yesterday is terrorist attack was as ' fault ?
there is no evidence to back up your claim.
how come they return to fight with them then. people like you are the reason yesterday happened
take away the free aide and these people would disappear
it is worth remembering that some of them are the same extremist we are fighting in the middle east
i just found this and never have i ever seen such a thing . sending all my love and support
i am new on twitter. how do i support ?
security forces storm sydney cafe where hostages held , gunman identified as man haron monis :
such a shame already convicted taking name of islam for his heinous crime
does not matter whoever ... no one has rights to kill anyone ...

man haron monis is believed to be the man behind the , his former lawyer says likely he acted alone

please read before you judge my religion and you will realism it is only a minority
this is from of arabiathe guy who fucked arabia big time
all authentic flags hijacked by the cult called wahhabi.
. baloney. most want subjugation of women, rape of children, death to infidels, domination.
it paid for by the cia. right ?
and this is peter o notable is flag.
i am i love my religion but also respect all other faiths
will you please include meanings of those inscriptions ? let people understand what drive those terrorists !
then they should put their battalions together and head off to destroy isis.
so it is a new convientant a ' new ' group just after the cia goes into defense mode

with lots and lots of irony
flags by terrorists in sydney cafe read " there is no god but allah , mohammed is the messenger of
ordered beheading of 600 men & amp ; enslaving their women. was mohammad a muslim ?
singulars r busy saying ---- was'nt religion related & amp ; that terrorism has no religion
ppm left in a rubble of sick'claims. now want to do the same in nepal.
how long will world leaders be politically correct to appease one community and stop themselves from telling the truth
still all are not like that.
well will the gentlemen trying to convert hindus to dignity attempt to convert the hearts of the terrorists ?
terrorists never belongs to any religion ...
the flag does not bear an is mark.

would if i but i 404 can not
to american gun nuts exploiting a situation half a world away to push your agenda : you are sick .
a child saying childish things please stop making americans look bad
the armed in the cafe is doing the same thing, except more
i love his liberals result to name calling when the known they are wrong.
sorry but plenty of people in australia actually like freedom and want you to bugger off.
so the good outweighs the bad ?
i do not recall saying that. again, do research. guns stop killers daily.
because a reference somehow makes america look bad, regardless ur logic is still childish
and when has that ever worked in the u.s ? gun lobby propaganda, ugh.
is this the guns do not kill people argument ?
who i am not a gun nut. i do not own one.
the law in allows for everyone to have guns and yet all those killings took place.
what about the 74 shootings resulted in 38 deaths and 53 injuries since sandy where they prevented ?
guns are legal in the u.s. why were not the school shootings prevented then by people inside ?
guns preventing disabling or injuring people is an accidental side effect of their purpose. murder.
or a shootout might have taken place and resulted in multiple casualties were as currently there are none.
it would be nice to have a device that is only purpose is murder ?
stop getting your info from wild west shows and heist movies.
interesting comment from someone with your display name.
in the hands of a good guy would have ended this long ago.
no. that would make you a nut.
i take that back it is much worse.
scroll through my time i red one like 5 minutes ago.
someone as stupid as yourself should never be allowed near a firearm.
people having guns caused those deaths, if guns where illegal they would still be alive.
show us a tweet from the us gun-nuts.
that is a interesting. anyone that might want to defend themselves is a gun nut.
the cops are good they all have guns, it is still going on.
do you mean if someone had a gun there would still be a hostage situation ?
this just hopes all the innocent people in that cafe get out unscathed.
tell me how a gun jumps and becomes violent ? . please, never seen it.
i stand in solidarity with muslim australians & amp ; condemn anyone who uses this as an excuse for islamaphobia
you are right. look at us trying to articulate ourselves and feelings in 140 words.
does anyone care about the hostages ' on ? extraordinary the number of people not mentioning them
hard call to convince true blue aussies dude. good luck
they come out of the woodwork. literally.
no one seems to care about them, they could just all die.
experiment over not compatible with aboriginal values. purge christian terrorists yesterday.
exactly that was exactly what i was trying to say.
then be cursed with more terrorist attacks, u ppm are not so naive, r u ?
so you have not been reading this tag then ? i am praying along withal the ' atheists '
that is a sickish thing to say. you left out the hostages
tony is so sexy looking
i do not think that is the case. during a crisis people may not be expressing themselves well
means any doubt man ?
it would make more sense to stand with secular australians to condemn anybody who uses religion/s as political tools
fingers crossed for sydney . one day we won‚Äôt live in a world where humans terrorise each other
if so then the notion that must be embraced universally.
the terrorize the public every day !
yep. but is still on the loose.
on what empirical basis are you making that claim ? ... sigh.
thanks solidarity appreciated.
when we are all right ?
we condemn the actions of the criminals at islam is free from terrorism . visit :
sisters. get back to work with fbi
who have been massacring the muslims for decades
may protect the people in sydney from harm
first declaration siege a success for isis !
do you condemn the actions of your malaya obama and cameroon
can not believe what is happening in sydney ... just hoping that no one gets hurt .
at least 13 hostages in the middle of sydney nd they are threatening to kill them
the they have hostages in sydney
i am so scared that something big is going to happen üò≠
the they have hostages in sydney
the they have hostages in sydney
everyone so insane but it is okay üíì
so close to home it is terrifying, hoping for the best too
the they have hostages in sydney
let is trust god thank you for following add
really we should pray for their safety. thank you btw
why may i know what is happening over there ?
please remember that it is an individual causing the not a faith or race . they speak for themselves ,
not really. calls for violence to non muslims. thought you should know.
sharing the truth is not bigotry. no real peace in islamic teachings.
championing the truth is not narrow minded is it ?
no point in letting him know. his ignorant and blaming the creator for writing such verse
of course it is cheers
it is hatred. telling people false information.
both are same things. means the same ‚Äú
that is a not an isis one. very similar, but not the same.
he is representing his faith with the sahara flag !
you are a complete idiot.
your words and demeanor have clearly communicated that islam is of peace. üòâ
i think that is pacifism at it is most deluded.
also fuck all religion. end of story
now when did i say that ? are you on drugs ?
and many more proving his piety
you are dumb. waste of oxygen.
if you knew how to read, you would know that that is not an isis flag.
what you do with this info i gave you be up to you, you bigotry is your problem
no one is insulting anyone.
a big both are same things. mean the same. prophets flag !
yep. there are 109 of them.
not true says kill who trying to kill you
that is the not the issue.
do you have an example ?
just to be clear i am not muslim i am christian.
how is it the solution ?
brother i am not i am christian. my god does not fight. he loves.
i feel sorry for you that you do not see the truth and chose to live in ignorance.
a major police operation is under way in sydney , australia ; police advise avoiding central business district .
i doubt these terrorists are of pakistani origin
thinking about you and everyone in sydney and their families.
holding hostages in cafe. how do i know this & amp ; not you ?
you are a tad late cnn. just 3 hours late.
police operation sounds like military. strange choice of words.
so is just the beginning . terrorist sympathetic group is running campaign in support of mehdi masroor .
this is a parody account ?
to any american tweeting about how could have been averted if we carried guns . no -- imagine how much
at least one would be dead now, and that‚Äôs one too many - word !
excellent comment we do not need guns in australia.
exactly. and chances are it would be an innocent bystander or someone trying to help somehow.
schools are zones which make them an easy target. wankers.
new created by me.
oh you mean it could have ended like this
is are the dumbest people on earth, guns do not solve anything
yep better off defenseless sheep huh
it is nice to know educational institutions are gun free
do not you remember in ww2 it was aussies that saved australia not american is
armed citizens stop mass shootings all the time, that is why they do not turn into mass shootings
some gun loving care more about their guns than people
when was the last time an armed citizen stopped a school shooting ?
exactly what i wanted to say within the limitation of 140 characters.
who takes a selfie in the middle of a hostage siege ? well these idiots do
that is just plain rude of them ! what if they had family in there
fools can not put brains in statutes
did you take this photo ?
i did not take this photo
name and shame i reckon !
well ....... it takes all kinds ...
that is a and no respect at all.
people like that pisses me off. no respect, no soul.
they would have taken more series ! so rude.
people like this make me lose faith in humanity.
so flipping inappropriate ... dumb twats.
lowest form of tact ever.
that is they honestly have no respect
agree stupid series. hate the word. peoples lives at risk here
there not even there fan lower than a snakes belly fan scum
like i love a self with friends ! but that was not a time and place
shame on them can not believe people would behave so inappropriately in this horrible situation
this is just as bad as what the media are doing-showing pained hostage faces ...
apparently 2 dumb bimbos !
these people are no idea so selfish. that the problem with the world now.
please do not use today as an excuse to be racist and bigoted . ignoring the telegraph would be a
ignoring the telegraph is always a good start.
and not all were nazis
it is not that has done this, most muslims are peace loving people
i thought most sensible people did.
all the telegraph is good for is inciting racism and making open minded people have rage induced strokes
i have been doing that for about 20 years.
selective reading i also said not to be bigoted.
auburn earlier today was business as usual busy bustling. not yet gripped by paranoia !

re : , please remember there are $1 . 6bn muslims in the world & amp ; & gt ;
one thing is for certain. this helps [almost] one is cause.
there can not be bigotry. islam is a religion. not a race.
the dollar sign was either auto correct or me mistyping. either way, whoops.
last i checked nobody from westboro was lopping off any heads. nice deflection. not comparable.
bad example. here you go :
i sincerely hope avoid defaulting to anti-islamic bigotry in the coming days & amp ; weeks.
6 in i did not know muslims were a form of currency
obviously getting autocratic.
i found this about it :
which group is actually following the teachings of the koran ?
so what had happened in sydney ?
hopefully the people there will not be injured or even murdered.
you can not just make shit up to support your narrative.
first i have heard of this. interesting ...
then let is here them condemn it. silence means consent.
actually about half of all muslims worldwide support sharia law which makes them extremist.
instead of calling the sydney cafe terrorist nothe terrorist ' , bbc is calling him nothe gunman ' . even
i suspect all these are purchased by saudi is oil money.
because by that definition all terrorists are people with flags. he is a gunman and a terrorist.
amp our bbc correspondent is calling them ‚Äú hostage takers ‚Äú !
this is the best way to say by disaffiliating them to any religion by saying note gun man '
people must understand that not stupid nor naive we read and learn about all culture n religion
are scared of circumcised muslim terror-i do not understand the logic !
wait what that would just create more terrorism. two wrongs do not make things right.
has lost its testicles to circumcised terrorists ! healthy mutilated development !
they would stop being terrorists and turn into islamic freedom fighters fighting against oppression.
and we are proud to be australian coming from different background to live in peace and harmony
is attracting perverted like a magnet ! any attack on nonmuslims calls for mosque demolition !
is unlike thy want 100% surety
your tweet is slap on her face
and ironically stops them from being terrorists. it turns them into people with a genuine issue.
again irreligious extremists hold innocent people hostage and hijack islam . our prayers with the hostages
did you even see how that stupid building fell ? hit on the top, collapsed from the bottom
the way it fell does not that intrigue you ?
i do not want to talk to you !
the never ruled peacefully are you insane ? ruthless killers
now i rest my case : *
you are from west bank or gaza, and would be killed if you left islam.
leave this idiot alone. let us talk
in to the in jerusalem, in iraq, cia torture etc. 3
you get off the twitter and read duran first
you need to read the duran correctly not based on your whims or desires.
sadly there is bad catholics islams muslims etc
so you defy this peace loving verses from the duran ? congratulation you are official ya non muslim
liking your own tweet would not help. ok let is start with facts rather you ignorant beliefs
read some more and you will find evil acts are consistent with islam.
in the flag was noticed during gaza war ... that is when government should have acted
i can not anyway. i lost your number. do you skype ?
go listen to your lectures and get off twitter !
we ruled this world peacefully for 700yrs and you idiot start defaming islam.
i will get back to you, let us talk
have read a little on muslim/islam seems so peaceful till extremists take it completely in different place
no do not call me you fool !
this is not yet only islam and muslims would be held responsible
you taught me something certain people liked it so in keeping this way
why do you not wear a hi jab if you know it is in the duran ?
hey in not violent can u guys leave me out of this fight
beautiful queen and its people who has hatred for our beautiful religion you taught me something
this is not hi it is traditional clothes in jordan !!
by no means an expert but what i have read shows me this is not true islam/muslim beliefs
you are as filthy as you filthy beliefs. allah is wrath upon you.
i pray for all the hostages
i did not mean to put in this sorry
you hijack by not enforcing islam in all matters and standing with koufax against islam !
maybe you just find easy excuses for atrocities committed in allah is name, like sex slavery.
we highly condemn this act of barbarity.
you put a hi jab on too !
the days of power is over the world is saying no more
to name one ayah of many.
you are so ignorant amp ; racist
do not call i will call you
except that it did not collapse from the bottom but from the top.
so what is hi jab ? is it from islam is it a choice of what ??
speaks for all muslims no more than the klu klux klan speaks for all whites . # sydney
that would be km ‚Äú flux klein. rooky mistake.
who will reform if moderate muslims refuse to speak honestly about the very doctrines in need of reform ?
have they confirmed it is isis related ?
except the are legal ...
however the inability of scholars to denounce such acts ? no excuse for not doing it.
that would only be true if all whites read from the same handbook as the kkk.
a minority does not represent the majority. that is the moral of this tweet.
white do you mean christians ?
it is all speculation. as my last tweet agrees it is probably amateur isis supporters
speaks for all muslims no more than the flu flux klein speaks for all whites. ‚Äù

if sydney had been texas 10 customers would have drawn guns the moment the isis terrorist walked in ...
the problem when you carry a gun you become judge/jury/executioner.
mate. if your case was true why are there so many children killed in us schools ?
who cares what the us allow this is oz and thank god we are not in the us
taken out by someone who had a gun was not it ?
careful you will get blocked. then where will you get your right-wing diatribe ?
fact most mass shorting have happened gun free zone areas. fact is last beheading here was stop
no there are armed teachers yet school shootings still occur. more people die in us of gun violence
hopefully you learn amp ; lose your naivete.
you are really this dumb ? look up texas gun ownership before you look any more stupid.
if you can not use the correct article, you are an idiot.
you have got that right !
gun control is people control.
you do not even research. you are a waste of effort. buh bye !
like i said i keep my cow worked well so far.
i most definitely do. i can not help the ignorant.
and what article are you referring to
who would have thought was a stone cold killer ?
oh no chuck is blocked me guess ‚Äú the truth ‚Äú hurts.
listen to this he just graduated college yesterday !!
. and were talking out the crack of your are then as well. pipe down.
show me a report that shows on average 10 texan in a cafe are armed ...
that is the stupidest thing anyone has said today.
i was thinking exactly that about you !
if had been more people would be dead thank god it is not
if truth makes you laugh so be it.
schools are gun free zones you idiot
easy you want to kill me, i kill you not rocket science
opinion a view or formed about something, not necessarily based on fact or knowledge. 2/2
i speak you fool would be the first ones dead in a hostage situation.
then i suggest you start reading what it takes in most states to get a concealed weapon permit
you have missed my point completely. your statement was an opinion not fact.
i speak you speak liberalism.
you are deluded. everything you have said is completely subjective.
by someone with a gun. or you prefer being beheaded ? your choice
you are far too thick to hold that responsibility.
what armed teachers know your facts
highly trained not some public who is been down to the local gun range
oh right of course what was i am thinking !!!! thx for clarifying
so did anyone really read the whole go and forensic report yet ? i did
lots of countries have say mexico where most can not carry
classic classic classic imbecile.
you are not thinking. that the point
so no facts just bullshit now. nice
and again your head up your ass, most states you have to pass certain training
it is called you want to hurt me, you go first.
says the man who makes wild claims then calls it fact.
this is twitter dumb unless you want it numbered it goes short.
if you do not even have the basic survival common sense, you are an idiot.
truth that which is true or in accordance with fact or reality opinion 1/2
i take my chance with a cow any day versus nothing
you mean aside from your original tweet here ?? lolll
again every school shooting has been in a gun free zone area.
whatever you jams bond. i am sure that would go great for you.
chuck is watching leave him alone
for the permission dude bro --- you do, in fact, make me laugh. lolllol
lets go back to the lone star times where you are most comfortable.
you are making my point.
it was not an it wiz truth g'and bless america.
has open is a gun free zone. duh !
us has no gun crime problems does it ?! you have said your opinion not ‚Äú truth ‚Äú
i am for gun owner ship but controls need to be in place. have good night annie oakley

no we have not had any massacres since we got rid of them. unlike america.

i hope history is wrong and i am wrong ... for your makes.
you got it false flags everywhere ! but people are waking up ! keep praying !
i stand behind empirical evidence.
so they should not respond at all ?
you are wrong. there are reasons why the us has so many more homicides and police shootings.

stop embarrassing yourself you fucking hippy.
are you going to protect your children and family with scissors ? good luck with that !
proud to be innocent people should not be victimized because of the actions of one
how about ... no violence in response to violence leads to more violence, not less.
are hostage takers or not ? strange that it is taking so long to identify them.
how many marched against hitler ? or against kkk ?
i hope history is wrong and that i am wrong
10,000 marched against a video. how many have marched against isis ?

irony calling for censorship of information is literally the opposite of (classical) liberalism.
was it necessary to say that he was granted asylum in australia ?
